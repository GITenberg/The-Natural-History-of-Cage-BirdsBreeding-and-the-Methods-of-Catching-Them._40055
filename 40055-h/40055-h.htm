<h3>AUTHOR&#8217;S PREFACE.</h3>

<p>The Natural History of <span class="smcap">Cage Birds</span>, which I now lay
before the public, is a work I have long been solicited to
write. There are many people who like to keep birds,
who neither know their habits nor the proper treatment
or food requisite for them. Even those who are not altogether
ignorant of these, often have but very limited,
superficial, and, what is worse, sometimes erroneous ideas
on the subject. It is for such readers I have given the
following Introduction; for professed naturalists will find
nothing there but what they have already learnt, either
from my own works or from those of other authors on
natural history.</p>

<p>If long experience and minute observation on the subject
of his work is calculated to gain an author credit, I
flatter myself that this will not be denied me, since
from my earliest youth I have delighted in being surrounded
with birds, and am so accustomed to them that
I cannot write at my desk with pleasure, or even with
attention, unless animated by the warbling of the pleasing
little creatures which enliven my room. My passion
is carried so far, that I always have about thirty birds
around me, and this has naturally led me to consider the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ii" id="Page_ii">ii</a></span>
best and easiest mode of procuring them, as well as of
feeding and preserving them in health. Few amateurs,
therefore, are better fitted than myself to write on this
subject; and I hope I have done it to the satisfaction of
the public. I ought also to notice in this place the plan
of my work, as my book may fall into the hands both of
those who might feel a wish to learn more particulars,
and of those who may think much less would have
sufficed.</p>

<p>I have described all the indigenous European birds with
which I am acquainted that are capable of being tamed,
and are pleasing in the house. As to foreign ones, I have
only spoken of those I have occasionally seen in Germany,
and which can be procured without much difficulty.</p>

<p>I have followed the same plan in their natural history
which I have pursued in my other works on birds.</p>

<p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Description.</span>&mdash;Under this head I have entered into
particular details, in order that the amateur may the
better satisfy himself in discriminating the species and
the sex of the bird before him. This knowledge is exceedingly
necessary, as the bird-dealers are not very scrupulous
in deceiving their customers, either by selling one
species for another, or a female for a male. These descriptions
may likewise have the advantage of inspiring a taste
for ornithology in the bosom of a mere amateur, who may,
by repeated observations, afterwards enrich this branch of
natural history with his own remarks.</p>

<p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Habitation.</span>&mdash;On forming a wish to possess any particular
bird, it is natural to try to discover what situations<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_iii" id="Page_iii">iii</a></span>
it frequents in order to find it, and when it has been found
and secured, a desire to know the best place to keep it in
follows as a matter of course.</p>

<p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Food.</span>&mdash;In keeping tame birds it is most important to
know what food is best adapted to each species; that is
to say, what approaches nearest to its natural aliment.
I have therefore divided the directions on this point into
two parts; showing in the first the natural food of the
bird in its wild state, and in the second what is best for it
in confinement.</p>

<p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Breeding.</span>&mdash;Many birds succeed best when reared from
the nest, which makes it necessary to speak of their manner
of being hatched, and the like.</p>

<p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Diseases.</span>&mdash;Birds being very tender creatures, on passing
from a state of liberty to slavery, in which they lose
the means of exercise and proper food, are soon afflicted
with many diseases occasioned by this change alone, without
reckoning others that naturally follow in their train.
Under this head I endeavour to point out these, and their
proper treatment; but I confess that this is the most
imperfect part of my work, and I wish some clever experienced
medical man would take the trouble to render it
more correct.</p>

<p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Chase.</span>&mdash;On going into the country a wish often arises
to procure a bird, and therefore under this head I have
described the method of catching such species as may be
desired.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">iv</a></span></p>

<p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Attractive Qualities.</span>&mdash;Under this head I have stated
the properties which render a bird worthy of our notice,
and of being tamed and kept in the house.</p>

<p>The volume ends with an alphabetical index, which will
enable a person instantly to find the birds whose history
he requires. May my work be as useful as it is my wish
to make it, and my intentions will be accomplished.</p>

<hr />

<h4>SECOND EDITION.</h4>

<p>The call for a second edition is no inconsiderable proof
to me that I accomplished my purpose in the first. None
of my works have had a more flattering reception, from all
classes of readers; but particularly from some of the most
distinguished, who have given me repeated proofs of their
satisfaction. I have also had the pleasure of assisting
many amateurs with my experience, who have honoured
me with questions. This pleasure is now increased by
being able to render these instructions general, and to
perfect this new edition by later observations, some communicated
by others, which I judged it right to introduce.
If any reader is surprised at not finding in this work many
foreign birds seen in France, Holland, or in some of the
maritime towns of Germany, it is because I have never
had an opportunity of observing them myself: in a word,
it is very pleasing to me to feel that my work has increased
the number of the lovers of natural history; and I hope
to see them still increasing. It is, indeed, my earnest wish<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">v</a></span>
that it may contribute more and more to the love of that
class of attractive creatures with which the Creator has
adorned the earth, and which sing His praises so melodiously
and unceasingly!</p>

<hr />

<h4>THIRD EDITION.</h4>

<p>A new edition of my Natural History of Cage Birds
having been called for, I have made many additions and
improvements in the work, as will appear on comparison.
Some have alleged that I have been too diffuse in my
descriptions, and others find fault that I have introduced
birds difficult to tame, such as the gold-crested wren and
the common wren. In the latter case, at least, the most
ample details are excusable, as the birds require more care;
yet I know several amateurs who always have one or two
wrens flying about a room, or in a cage, and to let loose so
delicate a little bird as the gold-crested wren always gives
great pleasure. Besides, the minutest detail can never, in
such cases, do any harm. I have likewise added some
foreign birds, several of which have been but recently
introduced in this country by bird dealers.</p>

<h4>NOTICE BY THE TRANSLATOR.</h4>

<p>The work of Dr. <span class="smcap">Bechstein</span> upon <span class="smcap">Cage Birds</span> has
been so highly esteemed on the Continent that it has
passed through several editions, both in the original and in
translations. Besides rendering as faithfully as care could
effect, the interesting details of the author, numerous notes
have been added, as well as several species introduced,
which have recently been kept with success in this country
by the Hon. and Rev. Mr. Herbert, Mr. Sweet, Mr.
Blyth, and others. The mode of management also peculiar
to these, and so different in some points from that
recommended by Dr. Bechstein, has been given in detail.
It is to be hoped that this translation may have similar
success, and produce similar effects in increasing the taste
for Natural History, which the original has had on the
Continent. It is proper to add, that the drawings of
cages, which illustrate this edition, were selected by permission
of Mr. Cato, Holborn Bridge, from the numerous
elegant specimens which his stock contains.</p>

<h2>NATURAL HISTORY OF CAGE BIRDS.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>INTRODUCTION.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap2">By cage birds</span>, I mean those kept by amateurs, for
amusement, in their apartments, generally selected for sweetness
of song or beauty of plumage; but the naturalist has other
reasons for surrounding himself with these pleasing creatures:
they enliven him, and he delights in studying their habits and
characters. To attain these objects it is necessary, in the first
place, to be able to distinguish readily between the males and
females, since the former are generally superior in their powers
of song, and therefore preferable. I have, for this reason, made
a point, in the following sketch of the history of house birds,
of showing the colours and other marks which characterise the
two sexes; and, as all birds cannot be tamed, whilst many
others offer no inducement to make the attempt, it follows
that those about to be spoken of must necessarily be but a
small proportion of all the known species of birds.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span></p>

<h4>SONGS OF TAME BIRDS.</h4>

<p>What is most prized and admired in house birds is undoubtedly
their song. This may be natural or artificial, the
former being as varied as the species of the birds, for I know
of no two indigenous species quite similar in their song; I
ought, perhaps, to except the three species of shrike I have
given, which, from their surprising memory, can imitate the
songs of other birds so as to be mistaken for them: but a
naturalist would soon perceive a slight mixture of the song
natural to the imitator, and thus easily distinguish between
the shrike that copied, and the titlark or red-breast copied
from<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a>. It is so much the more important to be well versed
in the different birds&#8217; songs, as to this knowledge alone we
are indebted for several curious observations on these pretty
creatures.</p>

<p>An artificial song is one borrowed from a bird that the young
ones have heard singing in the room, a person&#8217;s whistling, a
flageolet, or a bird-organ. Nearly all birds, when young,
will learn some strains of airs whistled or played to them regularly
every day; but it is only those whose memory is capable
of retaining these that will abandon their natural song, and adopt
fluently, and repeat without hesitation, the air that has been
taught them. Thus, a young goldfinch learns, it is true, some
part of the melody played to a bullfinch, but it will never be
able to render it as perfectly as this bird; a difference not
caused by the greater or less suppleness of the organ, but rather
by the superiority of memory in the one species over that of
the other.</p>

<p>We distinguish in birds a chirping and warbling, or song,
properly so called; besides this, several species, with a large,
fleshy, undivided tongue, are able to repeat articulate sounds,
and they are then said to <i>talk</i>, such as parrots and jays.</p>

<p>It is remarkable, that birds which do not sing all the year,
such as the red-breast, siskin, and goldfinch, seem obliged, after
moulting, to learn to warble, as though they had forgotten;
but I have seen enough to convince me that these attempts are
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
merely to render the larynx pliant, and are a kind of chirping,
the notes of which have but little relation to the proper song;
for a slight attention will discover that the larynx becomes
gradually capable of giving the common warble.</p>

<p>This method of recovering the song does not then show
deficiency of memory, but rigidity occasioned by the disuse of
the larynx. The chaffinch will exercise itself in this way some
weeks before it attains its former proficiency, and the nightingale
practises as long the strains of his beautiful song, before
he gives it full, clear, and in all its extent<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a>.</p>

<p>The strength and compass of a bird&#8217;s voice depend on the
size and proportionate force of the larynx. In the female it is
weak and small, and this accounts for her want of song. None
of our woodland songsters produces more striking, vigorous,
and prolonged sounds than the nightingale; and none is known
with so ample and strong a larynx: but as we are able to improve
the organisation of the body by exercise and habit, so
may we strengthen and extend the larynx of several birds of
the same species, so as to amplify the song in consequence, by
more nutritive food, proper care, sounds that excite emulation,
and the like; chaffinches, bullfinches, canaries, and other birds
reared in the house, furnish daily examples of this.</p>

<p>I should not omit mentioning here an observation of Mr.
Daines Barington<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">3</a>, which tends to prove the possibility of
improving the song of wild birds, by rearing linnets, sparrows,
and others, near some good warbler, such as a nightingale or
canary, and then setting them at liberty; but, though there
is some truth in this assertion, yet it is subject to certain restrictions.
I only know of two ways of carrying this idea into
execution; one by suspending the cages of the best warblers
in the orchard where the birds which they are to teach breed;
the other, to enclose these warblers in a large aviary of iron
wire, in the open air. There let them teach their young ones,
which may be set at liberty as soon as they are able to fly:
but birds taken very young from the nest, and reared, formed,
and educated in the house, would not have instinct to find
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>their food when set at liberty, and must perish of hunger, or
at least die in the winter.</p>

<p>The same remarks are applicable to a work published by
M. Gambory at Copenhagen, in the year 1800.</p>

<p>I think, indeed, it is better to be contented with possessing
in our houses artificial songs than to take so much trouble to
alter and spoil the very delightful music of nature<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">4</a>.</p>

<h4>HABITATIONS OF TAME BIRDS.</h4>

<p>The space assigned to tame birds varies according to their
nature and destination. All are less at ease in a cage than
when at liberty in a room, where young pine branches, cut in
winter or early in spring, should be placed for their accommodation<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">5</a>.
Several, however, never sing unless confined within
narrow limits, being obliged, as it would appear, to solace
themselves, for the want of liberty, with their song; consequently,
birds only prized for the beauty of their plumage or
their pleasing actions, are best placed in a room. Rather large
birds, such as thrushes, should have a room appropriated to
them, or be kept in a large aviary, as they give a very unpleasant
smell to the place which they occupy, unless carefully
cleaned; but their young ones may be allowed the range of
any apartment, placing in a corner a cage or branch to rest and
sleep on, where they may run and hop freely, seeking a roosting-place
for themselves in the evening, on the fir branches
placed for that purpose; or in a cage with several divisions,
into which they soon learn to retire. Some birds, such as the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>dunnock and the blue-breast, sing best in this state of liberty.
It is necessary to avoid placing them with shrikes or tits, as
these often, in the midst of plenty of food, will kill smaller
birds, for the sake of eating the brain or intestines. Those
that are confined that we may better enjoy the beauty of their
song, should have a cage proportioned to their natural vivacity:
a lark, for example, requires a larger cage than a chaffinch.
The habits of the birds must also be considered, whether they
rest on the ground or perch on sticks. Thus, the nightingale
must have perches, while the sky-lark never makes use of
these.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><img src="images/i_016.png" alt="Decoration." title="" height="703" width="500" />
<p class="caption">ORNAMENTAL WATER CAGE.</p></div>

<p>In the account of each bird I shall point out what shaped
cage I have found most suitable.</p>

<p>In every case cleanliness is absolutely necessary, in order to
keep birds a long time, as well as healthy and active. In
general it is better not to disturb the birds very often; but if
not every day, yet every week at furthest, it is necessary to
clean even the perches of those that roost, and strew sand where
they keep at the bottom. Negligence in this entails many
inconveniences,&mdash;unpleasant smells from sick birds, gouty feet
to some birds, loss of the use of their limbs or all their claws;
such sad experience may at length cure the negligent amateur.
&#8220;We love birds,&#8221; they say; &#8220;No,&#8221; I reply, &#8220;you love yourselves,
not them, if you neglect to keep them clean.&#8221;</p>

<p>In washing the feet of birds they must first be soaked in
warm water, or the dirt will be so pasted on the skin that in
removing it the bird will be wounded, and the irritation thus
excited may soon occasion dangerous ulcers. House birds are
generally subject to sore feet, and great attention is therefore
necessary to examine them often if they are not attacked; a
hair wound round them will sometimes become drawn so tight
that in time the part will shrivel up and drop off. Another
proof of the necessity of care in cleaning is, that few birds preserve
their claws after having been kept some years in the
house. It must be confessed, however, that among birds of
the same species there is a very marked difference in this
respect, some being always extremely clean, whilst others are
for ever dirty, and seldom clean themselves. There are also
some species in which cleanliness seems an innate quality;
among these are yellow hammers, reed buntings, and linnets;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
the latter especially have always appeared to me patterns of
neatness, and though I have had many, I do not recollect being
obliged to clean the feet of any, whilst larks and fauvettes have
them always dirty, and let them fester with ulcers rather than
take the trouble to clean them<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">6</a>.</p>

<p>Many amateurs amuse themselves with taming their birds
so completely that they can let them fly out of a window and
recall them at pleasure. A friend of mine, who tamed not
only birds, but also adders, otters, weasels, foxes, and the like,
knew how to render them so familiar that at the least sign
they would follow him anywhere. This method was as easy
as it was sure, and I can judge of it from having been an eye-witness
to the effect; it is as follows:</p>

<p>When he wishes to accustom a bird to fly out and return,
or go out of doors perched on his hand or shoulder, he begins
by opening the cage and teazing the bird with a feather. The
bird soon pecks at it, then at the finger, and at last ventures
outside the cage to fly on the finger presented to it. My
friend then caresses it, and gives it something nice to eat, so
that it soon becomes accustomed to feed on the hand. When
this is attained, he begins to teach it to come at a certain call,
and as soon as it will allow itself to be taken, he carries it
on his hand or shoulder from room to room, the doors and
windows being at first well closed; he also lets it fly about a
little, making it return when called. At last, when the bird
comes at his call, without hesitation or fear of men or animals,
he tries it with precaution out of doors. It thus by degrees
becomes so accustomed to him that he can take it into the
garden, even in the midst of a large company, without any fear
of its flying away.</p>

<p>Great precaution is necessary in spring, and during the
pairing season, when taking out old birds that have been thus
trained; for, upon hearing the call of their own species, they
soon fly off to resume their wild state. Young linnets, bullfinches,
and canaries, are the species with which this method
succeeds best.</p>

<h4>FOOD OF TAME BIRDS.</h4>

<p>It is very necessary to procure for house birds food which
is like, or at least which nearly resembles, what they would
procure for themselves in their wild state. This is rather
difficult, and sometimes almost impossible, for where can we
find in our climate the seeds on which the Indian birds feed
in their own country? Our only resource then is to endeavour,
with judgment, to accustom these birds to that food which
necessity obliges us to give them. There are some birds, such
as chaffinches, bullfinches, thrushes, and the Bohemian chatterer,
which are so manageable in this respect, that as soon
as they are brought into the house they eat without hesitation
anything that is given to them; but others, which are more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
delicate, will absolutely eat nothing, either through disgust of
their new food, or despair at the loss of their liberty; with
these great precaution is necessary. Dr. Meyer, of Offenbach,
writes to me on this subject as follows: &#8220;The following is
the best method of accustoming newly-taken birds to their
change of food, a thing which is often very difficult to accomplish
with some species. After having put the bird in the
cage it must be left quiet for some hours, without disturbing
it at all; it must then be taken and plunged into fresh water,
and immediately replaced in the cage. At first it will appear
faint and exhausted, but it will soon recover, arrange its feathers,
become quite lively, and will be sure to eat whatever is given
to it. It is a well known fact that bathing gives an appetite
to birds, for the same reason that it does to men.&#8221;</p>

<p>If, as an exception, one of these delicate birds, among which
are most of the songsters, eats with eagerness as soon as it is
brought into the house, it is a sign of death, for it seems like
an indifference which is not natural, and which is always the
consequence of disease. Those birds which retire into a corner,
moping for some hours, are the most likely to live; it is only
requisite to leave them alone, and by degrees they recover from
their sullenness.</p>

<p>In order to give some general rules for the best food for house
birds, I have divided them into four classes:&mdash;</p>

<p>The first comprehends those birds which live only on seeds,
such as canaries, goldfinches, and siskins.</p>

<p>The second are those which feed on both seeds and insects,
such as quails, larks, chaffinches, and bullfinches; some of
these also eat berries and the buds of trees.</p>

<p>The third are those which seek only berries and insects, such
as nightingales, red-breasts, thrushes, and fauvettes.</p>

<p>The fourth are those which eat insects only, such as wagtails,
wheatears, stonechats, and blue-breasts.</p>

<p>The species in this last class are the most difficult to
preserve; but most of them, having nothing particular in
their song, offer no compensation for the trouble and care
which they require; but the following is the best method for
success. After having collected the flies, which in spring
may often be seen in great numbers on the windows of old
buildings, they must be dried, and preserved in a jar. When<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
live insects can no longer be found, these flies must be mixed
with the paste, hereafter described, which may be regarded as
a general or universal food, and given to the most delicate
birds, such as nightingales, provided ants&#8217; eggs or meal worms
are now and then mixed with it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Recipe for the general food.</span>&mdash;In proportion to the
number of birds, white bread enough must be baked to last
for three months. When it is well baked, and stale, it must
be put again into the oven, and left there until cold. It is
then fit to be pounded in a mortar, and will keep several
months without becoming bad. Every day a teaspoonful for
each bird is taken of this meal, on which is poured three
times as much cold, or lukewarm, but not boiling, milk. If
the meal be good, a firm paste will be formed, which must be
chopped very small on a board. This paste, which is very
nourishing, may be kept a long time without becoming sour
or sticky; on the contrary, it is always dry and brittle. As
soon as a delicate bird is brought in, some flies or chopped
worms should be mixed with the paste, which will attract it to
eat. It will soon be accustomed to this food, which will keep
it in life and health.</p>

<p>Experience teaches me that a mixture of crushed canary,
hemp, and rape-seed, is the favourite food of canaries; goldfinches
and siskins prefer poppy-seed, and sometimes a little
crushed hemp-seed; linnets and bullfinches like the rape-seed
alone. It is better to <i>soak</i> it for the young chaffinches, bullfinches,
and others; in order to do this, as much rape-seed as
is wanted should be put into a jar, covered with water, and
placed in a moderate heat, in winter near the fire, in summer
in the sun. If this is done in the morning, after feeding the
birds, the soaked seed will do for the next morning. All of
them ought to have green food besides, as chickweed, cabbage
leaves, lettuce, endive, and water-cresses. Sand should be
put in the bottom of the cages, for it seems necessary for
digestion<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">7</a>.</p>

<p>Amongst those of the second class, the quails like cheese
and the crumbs of bread; the lark barley-meal, with cabbage,
chopped cress, poppy-seed mixed with bread crumbs, and in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>winter, oats; the chaffinches, rape-seed, and sometimes in
summer a little crushed hemp-seed. Too much hemp-seed,
however, is hurtful to birds, and should only be given as a
delicacy now and then, for when they eat too much of it they
become asthmatic, blind, and generally die of consumption.
Yellowhammers like the same food as the larks, without the
vegetables; the tits like hemp-seed, pine-seed, bacon, meat,
suet, bread, walnuts, almonds, and filberts.</p>

<p>The birds of the first class are easily preserved in the house,
at least if not taken during the pairing season, for then the loss
of their liberty affects them so much that they become sullen,
and die of hunger.</p>

<p>Although the notice of a universal remedy is generally
rather suspected, I cannot refrain from here recommending
one or two sorts of paste which I have always used, and which
agreed so well with all my birds, excepting those which I keep
in cages on account of their beautiful songs, that it may justly
be termed general or universal food: it is not only very simple
and cheap, but also prevents great loss of time to those who
possess a great many birds.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The universal paste.</span>&mdash;To make the first paste, take a
white loaf which is well baked and stale, put it into fresh
water, and leave it there until quite soaked through, then
squeeze out the water and pour boiled milk over the loaf<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">8</a>,
adding about two thirds of barley-meal with the bran well
sifted out, or, what is still better, wheat-meal; but, as this is
dearer, it may be done without.</p>

<p>For the second paste, grate a carrot very nicely (this root
may be kept a whole year if buried in sand), then soak a
small white loaf in fresh water, press the water out, and put
it and the grated carrot into an earthen pan, add two handfuls
of barley or wheat meal, and mix the whole well together with
a pestle.</p>

<p>These pastes should be made fresh every morning, as they
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>soon become sour, particularly the first, and consequently
hurtful. For this purpose I have a feeding-trough, round
which there is room enough for half my birds. It is better
to have it made of earthenware, stone, or delft ware, rather
than wood, as being more easily cleaned, and not so likely to
cause the food to become sour.</p>

<p>The first paste agrees so well with all my birds, which are
not more than thirty or forty, at liberty in the room, that they
are always healthy, and preserve their feathers, so that they
have no appearance of being prisoners. Those which live only
on seeds, or only on insects, eat this food with equal avidity;
and chaffinches, linnets, goldfinches, siskins, canaries, fauvettes,
red-breasts, all species of larks, quails, yellowhammers, buntings,
blue-breasts, and redstarts may be seen eating out of the
same dish.</p>

<p>Sometimes, as a delicacy, they may be given a little hemp,
poppy, and rape-seed, crumbs of bread, and ants&#8217; eggs. One of
these is necessary for the birds of the third and fourth class.</p>

<p>Every morning fresh water must be given to the birds, both
for drinking and bathing. When a great many are left at
liberty, one dish will do for them all, about eight inches long
and two in depth and width, divided into several partitions, by
which means they are prevented from plunging entirely into the
water, and in consequence making the place always dirty
and damp<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">9</a>. A vessel of the same size and shape will do for
holding the universal paste, but then it must have no partitions.
Quails and larks require sand, which does for them instead of
water for bathing.</p>

<p>Some birds swallow directly whatever is thrown to them:
great care must be taken to avoid giving them anything with
pepper on it, or bad meat. This must be a general rule. I
shall also remark, that food sufficient for one day only must
be given to birds kept in cages, for they are accustomed to
scatter it about, picking out the best, and leaving only the
worst for the next morning; this makes them pine, and puts,
them out of humour.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sweet&#8217;s food for soft-billed birds (sylviad&aelig;).</span>&mdash;The
birds of this sort, though the finest songsters and most
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>interesting of all the feathered tribe, have been less known or
noticed than others, probably owing to the greater number
only visiting us in summer, when the trees are so densely
clothed with foliage that birds are not easily seen, and when
heard sing are generally considered by those who hear them to
be either blackbirds or thrushes, or some of the more common
singing birds. When they are seen the greater number of
them receive the general appellation of white-throat, without
distinction, though this is rather singular, since they are all
very distinct when examined, and their songs are all very
different. If you speak to a bird-fancier or bird-catcher about
any of them, you might as well talk of a bird in the wilds of
America, for they know nothing of them. Many of them are
therefore difficult to be procured in the neighbourhood of
London, though most of them are plentiful there.</p>

<p>With care, the whole of them may be preserved in good
health through the year, and many of them will sing through
the greater part of the winter if properly managed. They
require to be kept warm; the room in which they are should
never be allowed to be below temperate, or they will suffer
from it, particularly the tender sorts; at first the cold will
make them lose their sight, after which they seldom recover.
The redstart and nightingale are most subject to this; it sometimes
also happens to the fauvette, and also to the whinchat.</p>

<p>When in a wild state, the birds of this sort feed principally
on insects or fruit, and berries of various kinds. None of them
are seed birds, so that they must be managed accordingly.
The general food which I give them is hemp-seed, bruised up
in boiling water, as small as it can be made; I then put to this
about the same quantity, or rather more of bread, on which is
also poured boiling water, and then the whole is bruised up
together into a moist paste, particular care being required that
there be very little or no salt in the bread; for should there be
rather much it will kill the whole of the birds. The food
should also be mixed up fresh every morning, as it soon spoils
and turns sour, in which case the birds will not touch it, and
sometimes it will make them go off their food altogether.
When given to the birds, some fresh, raw, lean meat ought to
be cut up small enough for them to swallow, and mixed with it
I generally put about the same quantity of meat as paste, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
sometimes they will peck out the meat and leave the paste; at
other times they will eat the paste and leave the meat; but in
general they eat it all up together, particularly where several
different species are kept together in the same large cage, a plan
which I consider by far the best, as they amuse each other, and
keep one another warm in cold weather. Besides the above
food, an egg should be boiled very hard, the yolk taken out
and crumbled or cut in small pieces for them; the white they
will not eat. One egg I consider enough for twenty birds for
one day, with their other food, it being only intended as a
change of diet, which they will not continue well in health
without.</p>

<p>The sorts, which feed on insects when wild, should have
some of these preserved for them through the winter, except
where they can be procured at all seasons. At a baker&#8217;s shop,
for instance, there are always plenty of meal-worms, crickets,
and cockroaches, of which most of these birds are very fond:
when those are not to be procured, a good substitute is the
large white grubs that produce the cockchafers, which in some
years are very plentiful, and may be kept in pots of turfy
earth through the winter, as may also the maggots of the bluebottle
fly, if procured late in the autumn; and they may be
generally had as late as December. A quantity of these, kept
in a pot of turfy earth in a cellar, or any other cool place,
where they may not turn into flies too soon, is, I think, one of
the best sorts of insects, and easiest kept and procured, for such
birds through the winter. They will not touch them until
they are well cleaned in the mould, but are then very fond of
them, and a few every day keeps them in excellent health, and
provokes them to sing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hon. and Rev. W. Herbert&#8217;s food for soft-billed
birds.</span>&mdash;Milk, which Mr. Sweet recommends, I have found
very fatal to many of the soft-billed birds, and I never give it;
but the blackcaps do not seem to suffer from it. They are
very fond of a boiled carrot mashed and moistened, or beet-root
boiled and mashed. A boiled carrot will keep fresh many days,
in a basin of cold water, and is an excellent substitute for fruit
in feeding them. Boiled cabbage, cauliflower, green peas are
good for them; all sorts of puddings; a very little roast meat
minced, I give them every day, and a little yolk of egg when it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
suits, but it is not necessary. The standard food is hemp-seed
ground in a coffee-mill, and bread crumbs scalded and mashed
up together, and fresh every day. They are very fond of ripe
pears and elderberries (but elderberries stain the cage very
much), currants, cherries, honeysuckle, and privet-berries.</p>

<p>Professor Rennie says, &#8220;I have more than once given the
blackcap and other birds a little milk by way of medicine
when they appeared drooping or sickly, and with manifest
advantage<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">10</a>.&#8221;</p>

<h4>BREEDING OF TAME BIRDS.</h4>

<p>House birds, being most of them reared like canaries, can
only be made pair with great difficulty. When this object is
accomplished, all of them require a large quiet place, a whole
room if it can be had, in which branches of pine should be put,&mdash;a
place, in fact, as much as possible resembling their natural
abodes. But should you succeed in this respect, as you can
never procure the materials which form the general base of
their nests, it is better to give them artificial ones, made of the
bark of the osier, straw, or even turnings of wood, in which it
is only to put the soft stuff for lining, such as wool, the ravelings
of silk, linen, or cotton, and the birds will take possession
of it.</p>

<p>It is of consequence that the food for paired birds, and for
the different ages of their young ones, should be chosen with
judgment. I shall mention what must be done in this respect,
in the articles relating to the different species of birds which I
am going to describe in this work.</p>

<p>I must not omit two interesting observations which were
communicated to me by a lady of my acquaintance. It sometimes
happens, during a dry season, that the young birds are
not hatched on the proper day, or are in danger of not being
hatched at all; if, in this case they are plunged for one minute
in water about their own warmth, and then replaced under the
bird, the effect will be as quick as it is successful<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">11</a>.</p>

<p>For the same reason, sometimes the young birds remain
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>without their feathers beyond the proper time; a tepid bath
removes with such success the dryness of their quills, that in
twenty-four hours after replacing them damp in their nest
they are in general covered with feathers. I shall end this
paragraph with showing at what time it is best to remove
young wild birds from their nest when intended to be reared.
It is when the quills of the tail feathers are come out, and the
other feathers are begun to grow, the eyes not being quite
open. If removed earlier, their stomach will be too weak to
support their new food; if taken later, it will be very difficult
to make them open their beaks to receive a food which is
unknown to them. There are some species, however, that are
so easily reared, that any time will answer.</p>

<h4>DISORDERS OF TAME BIRDS.</h4>

<p>All tame animals are much more subject to disease than
wild ones; and birds so much the more, as they are often shut
up in very small cages, where they can take no exercise. It is
often supposed that birds, in their natural free state, have no
diseases; but people who will take the trouble to observe, will
soon perceive the falsehood of this assertion. I have often
found hedge-sparrows full of pimples, particularly in the naked
parts, the feet, and round the beak. Their diseases are often
increased by the delicacies of all kinds which are given them,
such as biscuits and sugar, which injure the stomach, and cause
a slow decay.</p>

<p>The principal diseases and their cures, according to my
experience, are as follows; not, however, that different birds do
not require, according to their food, different treatment.</p>

<p>I shall mention, under each bird, what must be done to cure
those diseases which are peculiar to it, when general remedies
fail.</p>

<h5>
THE PIP.
</h5>

<p>This is a catarrh, or cold, by which the nostrils are stopped
up, and the membrane covering the tongue is hardened by
inflammation. In large birds it is common to remove this
skin, taking it off from the base to the tip: by this means this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
part can again perspire, the saliva necessary for digestion can
flow, and the taste and appetite returns. A mixture of fresh
butter, pepper, and garlic, generally cures this catarrh. It is a
good thing, also, for the birds to drink the pectoral infusion of
speedwell; and the nostrils may be opened by passing up a
small feather. The ruffling of the head, the beak often open
and yellow at its base, and the tongue dry, are the most
decisive indications of this disease.</p>

<h5>
THE RHEUM.
</h5>

<p>The symptoms of this disease are frequent sneezing and
shaking of the head. Some drops of pectoral elixir in the infusion
of speedwell, which the sick birds must be made to take,
appears to me to be the most efficacious remedy. I have given
fowls even twenty drops of the elixir in a glass of the infusion.</p>

<p>When it is merely hoarseness, Dr. Handel, of Mayence, gave
to his birds for several days, as their only drink, a very diluted
decoction of dry figs, sweetened with a little sugar, and afterwards
purged them for two days following, with the juice of
carrots.</p>

<h5>
ASTHMA.
</h5>

<p>This is a very common disease among house birds. Those
attacked with it have their breath short, often open their beaks
as if to gasp for more air, and, when agitated or frightened,
keep them open for a long time.</p>

<p>The cause of this disease may doubtless be found in the mode
of life which these birds lead. Their food is generally too dry
and heating, being principally hemp-seed, which is very injurious,
but liked by all; and is the more hurtful, as it inclines
them to eat too much. If to this be added the unchanged air
of the rooms, particularly those which have stoves instead of
chimneys, and the great heat which is kept up during winter,
it is plain that there is much to injure the delicate lungs of
these birds.</p>

<p>A moist and refreshing regimen and some aperients, more or
less often, according to the violence of the disease, appears the
most appropriate remedy. A favourite linnet and goldfinch,
when attacked with very bad asthma, were relieved and preserved
for several years by the following method.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span></p>

<p>The first thing was to leave off hemp-seed entirely, confining
them solely to rape-seed; but giving them at the same time
abundance of bread, soaked in pure water, and then pressed;
lettuce, endive, or water-cresses, according to the seasons, twice
a week, giving them boiled bread and milk, about the size of
a nutmeg. This is made by throwing a piece of the crumb of
white bread, about the size of a nut, into a teacupful of milk,
boiling it, and stirring it all the time with a wooden spoon till
it is of the consistency of pap. It must be quite cold before it
is given to the birds, and must always be made fresh, for if sour
it will prove injurious.</p>

<p>This paste, which they are very fond of, purges them sufficiently,
and sensibly relieves them. In very violent attacks,
nothing but this paste ought to be given for two or three days
following, and this will soon give the desired relief.</p>

<p>When the disease is slight, or only begun, it is sufficient to
give the bread and milk once in three or four days. When
employed under similar circumstances, this treatment has cured
several very valuable birds. It may not be useless here to
renew the advice of always giving the birds an opportunity of
bathing every day, by putting in their way a saucer, or any
other small shallow bath, filled with water, which should never
be too cold, and in winter always milk-warm.</p>

<p>One thing which is very injurious to the lungs of birds, and
which too often occurs, is the fright occasioned by tormenting
them, or by seizing them too suddenly; for the poor little
things often rupture a blood-vessel in the breast while beating
themselves about: a drop of blood in the beak is the sign, and
a speedy death is the general consequence. If this do not
happen, the breathing is not the less difficult and painful;
and recovery is rare, at least without the greatest care and
attention.</p>

<p>Birds which eat insects and worms, occasionally, by accident,
swallow some extraneous substance, which, sticking in their
throat, stops their respiration, and stifles them. The only
remedy is to extract the foreign body, which requires much
skill and dexterity.</p>

<p>When asthma is brought on by eating seeds which are too
old, spoiled, or rancid, Dr. Handel recommends some drops of
oxymel to be swallowed for eight days following. But the best<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
way is to change the seed, and be sure there is none but good
seed in the trough.</p>

<h5>
ATROPHY, OR WASTING.
</h5>

<p>This is caused by giving unnatural food to the bird, which
destroys the digestive power of its stomach. In this case it
disgorges, ruffles its feathers, and does not arrange them, and
becomes thin very fast. The best thing is to make it swallow
a common spider, which purges it, and put a rusty nail into its
water, which strengthens the intestines, giving it at the same
time its proper and natural food. Green food, such as lettuce,
endive, chickweed, and particularly water-cresses, is the safest
remedy. A very great appetite is a sign of this disease. A
siskin, that was dying of atrophy, had nothing but water-cresses
for three days following, and on the fourth he sung.</p>

<h5>
CONSUMPTION, OR DECLINE.
</h5>

<p>This disorder may be known by the extreme thinness of the
breast, the swelling of the lower part of the belly, the total loss
of appetite, and similar symptoms. As a cure, Dr. Handel
recommends the juice of the white turnip to be given to drink
instead of water.</p>

<h5>
COSTIVENESS.
</h5>

<p>This disease may be discovered from the frequent unsuccessful
endeavours of the bird to relieve itself. Aperients will be
of use. If a spider does not produce the desired effect, anoint
the vent of the bird with the head of a pin steeped in linseed
oil; this sort of clyster generally succeeds; but if the disease
attacks a bird which eats meal-worms, one of these, bruised in
sweet oil and saffron, is the most certain remedy, and the bird
will swallow it without the least hesitation. Boiled bread and
milk is generally of great use.</p>

<h5>
DIARRH&OElig;A.
</h5>

<p>This is a disease to which birds that have been caught
recently are very subject, before they are accustomed to their
new food. Most of these die of it: they continually void a
white calcareous matter, which sticks to the feathers round the
vent, and being very acrid causes inflammation in that part
and in the intestines. Sometimes chalybeate water and the
oil clyster produce good effects; but it is better, if possible, to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
procure for the bird its most natural food. Some people pull
out the feathers from the tail and vent, and then rub these
parts with fresh butter, but this is a very painful and cruel
operation. They also mix the yolk of an egg boiled very hard
with their food, but I have never found this succeed very well.
If there be any hope of curing this disease it is by attacking it
at the beginning, before inflammation is violent; boiled bread
and milk, a great deal of lettuce, or any other similar green
refreshing food, in general completely cures them.</p>

<p>In a case of chronic diarrh&oelig;a, which almost reduces the birds
to skeletons, Dr. Handel prescribes chalybeate water mixed
with a little milk for their drink, which, he says, is an easy
and certain cure.</p>

<h5>
THE BLOODY FLUX.
</h5>

<p>This is a disease with which some parrots are attacked. The
best remedy is to make the birds drink a great deal of boiled
milk, or even very fat broth; for their intestines, which are
very much irritated, require something soothing to protect
them from the acrid discharges, which, at the same time, must
be corrected by healing food. Birds in this state generally do
nothing but drink, therefore plenty of boiled milk should be
given them, as it nourishes them, as well as acts medicinally,
but should it appear to turn sour in the stomach it must, at
least for some time, be discontinued.</p>

<h5>
OBSTRUCTION IN THE RUMP GLAND.
</h5>

<p>This gland, which is on the rump, and contains the oil
necessary for anointing the feathers, sometimes becomes hard
and inflamed, and an abscess forms there. In this case the
bird often pierces it itself, or it may be softened by applying
fresh butter without any salt; but it is better to use an ointment
made of white lead, litharge, wax, and olive oil, which
may be had at any good chemist&#8217;s. The general method is to
pierce or cut the hardened gland, in order to let out the
matter, but if this operation removes the obstruction it also
destroys the gland, and the bird will die in the next moulting,
for want of oil to soften the feathers<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">12</a>.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span></p>
<p>The gland is known to be obstructed when the feathers
which surround it are ruffled, the bird never ceasing to peck
them, and instead of being yellow it becomes brown. This
disease is very rare among wild birds, for, being exposed to
damp, and bathing often, they make more use of the liquor in
the gland, consequently it does not accumulate sufficiently to
become corrupted, sour, or cancerous. This confirms the
necessity of giving them the means of bathing as often as instinct
would induce them, as nothing can be more favourable
to their health.</p>

<p>Dr. Handel, after piercing the gland, recommends a little
magnesia to be mixed with the bird&#8217;s drink.</p>

<h5>
EPILEPSY.
</h5>

<p>This is a disease with which house birds are very often attacked.
What I have found to be most useful in this case
is to plunge the sick birds every now and then into very cold
water, letting them fall suddenly into it, and cutting their
claws, or at least one or two, short enough for the blood to run.</p>

<p>From bleeding giving so much relief one would think that
this disease is a kind of apoplexy, occasioned by want of exercise
and too much food. Bullfinches and thrushes are more
subject to it than any other birds, and bleeding always cures
them. I have seen this done with great success in the following
manner, but much delicacy and skill are required, as there
would be great danger of laming the bird:&mdash;a very small hole
is made on the surface of the claw, with a lancet or very sharp
penknife; it is then plunged in lukewarm water, and if the
operation be well done the blood runs like a thread of red silk;
when removed from the water the bleeding stops: no bandage
or dressing is required.</p>

<h5>
TYMPANY.
</h5>

<p>In this disorder the skin on one part of the body, or even the
whole body, rises and swells to so great a degree that it is
stretched like a drum. It is generally sufficient to pierce it
with a pin, so as to let the air escape, and the bird will be
cured. I had some larks attacked with this disease, which
began again to sing a quarter of an hour after the operation.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span></p>

<h5>
DISEASE IN THE FEET.
</h5>

<p>House birds are often subject to bad feet. From the second
year they become pale, and lose their freshness. They must
be frequently cleaned, taking care to remove the skin; the
thick loose scales ought also to be taken off, but with all possible
precaution.</p>

<p>The gout occasions the feet to swell, they are also so scaly
and painful that the poor little bird cannot support itself without
resting on the points of its wings. Dr. Handel prescribes a
warm fomentation with a decoction of soapwort. If a foot
should be bruised or broken, he advises that the diseased bird
should be shut up in a very small cage, the bottom of which is
very smooth and even, without any perches, or anything which
would tempt them to hop, and put in a very quiet and solitary
place, out of the way of anything which might produce agitation.
In this manner the bird will cure itself in a little time,
without any bandage or plaster of any kind.</p>

<p>I am persuaded that the principal cause of bad feet is want
of bathing. The scales, contracting from dryness, occasion
great pain; in order to remove them with ease, and without
danger, the feet must be softened in lukewarm water. I
have seen the following method used with a bullfinch:&mdash;its
cage was made with a moveable tin bottom, which being half
or three quarters of an inch deep, could hold water, which was
put in tepid, to bathe the bird; the perches were then
removed, so that the bird was obliged to remain in the water,
where it was left for half an hour, sometimes throwing it
hemp-seed to amuse it. After repeating the bath once or
twice the bird became very fond of it; and it was remarked
that its feet became, if we may say so, quite young again.
The scales being sufficiently softened, the middle of each was
cut lengthways without reaching the flesh, this made the sides
easily fall off. It is better to remove only two scales a-day,
that the bird may not be wearied. By continuing the bath
three times a week the feet become healthy and supple, and
the bird is easy.</p>

<h5>
SORE EYES.
</h5>

<p>The juice of red-beet for drink, and also as a liniment,
greatly relieves this disorder. Dr. Handel recommends wash<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>ing
the eyes, when disposed to blindness, with an infusion of
the root of white hellebore.</p>

<h5>
TUMOURS AND ULCERS.
</h5>

<p>As to the tumours and ulcers which come on the heads of
the birds, Dr. Handel touches them with a middling-sized
red hot knitting-needle. This makes the watery humour
run out, the wound afterwards dries and heals. To soften the
pain a little liquid black soap is used. If, from the softness
of the tumour, matter seems to have formed, it should be
rubbed with fresh butter until it is come to a head; it may
then be emptied, and opened by a few drops of essence of
myrrh. During all this time the bird must have nothing but
beet juice to drink.</p>

<p>Ulcers in the palate and throat may be cured by making
the bird drink the milk of almonds for several days, at the
same time lightly touching the ulcers several times a-day with
a feather dipped in a mixture of honey and borax.</p>

<h5>
MOULTING.
</h5>

<p>Though natural, is generally accompanied with disease, during
which the birds ought to be taken great care of. Their food
should be changed, but without giving any heating delicacies,
which are very injurious.</p>

<p>It has been observed that birds always moult at the time
when their food is most abundant; the forest birds may then
be seen approaching fields and cultivated places, where, having
plenty of insects and seeds, they cannot suffer from want;
indeed, the loss of their feathers prevents their taking long
flights, and the reproduction of them occasions a loss of flesh
which must be repaired. An abundance of food is therefore
necessary, and, following this rule, during moulting some
additional food must be given to house birds, appropriate to
the different species&mdash;millet or canary seed, a little hemp-seed,
white bread soaked in water, and lettuce, or endive, to those
which feed on seeds; with a few more meal worms and
ants&#8217; eggs to those that eat insects: all should have bread
soaked in boiled milk, warmth, and baths. Nothing has succeeded
better than this regimen: all the birds which I have
seen treated in this manner have passed their moulting season
in good health.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span></p>

<h5>GIDDINESS.</h5>

<p>This, without being properly a disease, is rather common,
and is occasioned by the trick which the birds of the first
class have, of turning their head and neck so far round that
they fall head over heels. They may be easily cured of this
trick by throwing a covering over the top of the cage, which
prevents their seeing anything above them, for it is with
looking up that this <i>giddiness</i> comes on.</p>

<h5>PAIRING FEVER.</h5>

<p>A disease which may be called the <i>pairing fever</i> must not
be forgotten here. House birds are usually attacked with it
in May, a time when the inclination to pair is greatest. They
cease to sing, become sorrowful and thin, ruffle their feathers,
and die. This fever generally first seizes those which are
confined in cages: it appears to arise from their way of life,
which is too uniform and wearying. I cured several by merely
placing them in the window, where they are soon so much
refreshed that they forget their grief, their desire for liberty or
for pairing, and resume their liveliness and song.</p>

<p>I have observed that a single female in the room is sufficient
to cause this disease to all the males of the same family,
though of different species. Removing the female will cure
them directly. The males and females at this season must be
separated, so that they cannot see or hear one another. This
perhaps is the reason that a male, when put in the window, is
soon cured.</p>

<h4>AGE OF TAME BIRDS.</h4>

<p>The length of a bird&#8217;s life very much depends on the care
which is taken of it. There are some parrots which have
lived more than a century; and nightingales, chaffinches, and
goldfinches have been known to live more than twenty-four
years in a cage. The age of house birds is so much the more
interesting, as it is only by observing it that we can know
with any degree of certainty the length of birds&#8217; lives in
general. Thus house birds are of importance to the naturalist,
as giving him information which he could not otherwise
acquire. It is worthy of remark, that the quick growth of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
birds does not prevent their living much longer than quadrupeds.
The length of life with these is estimated to be six or
seven times longer than the time which they take to grow:
while birds live fifteen, twenty, and even thirty times longer.</p>

<p>This length of life is sometimes attributed to the substance
of which the bones are composed being much more loose and
light, and consequently remaining porous longer than those of
quadrupeds. Some swans have lived three hundred years.</p>

<h4>BIRD CATCHING.</h4>

<p>We are furnished with house birds by the bird catchers
and bird sellers; the latter procure foreign birds, and teach
them, the former the indigenous ones. A good bird catcher
ought to know not only the different modes of taking birds,
but also all the calls for attracting the different species and
sexes: the call notes vary very much among house birds,
according to their passions and wants; thus the common
chaffinch, when calling its companions, often repeats <i>iack</i>,
<i>iack</i>; when expressing joy, <i>fink</i>, <i>fink</i>, which it also does when
angry, though louder and more quickly; whilst its cry of
sorrow is <i>treef</i>, <i>treef</i>.</p>

<p>The science of bird catching consists in studying these
different languages well, and it will ensure success.</p>

<p>As each species of bird requires a different mode, I shall
mention the various methods in the course of the work, and
shall here only speak of bird catching in general. The first
thing to know is the proper time to take birds. For birds of
passage, impelled by cold and want of food to change their
climate, nets should be spread in spring and autumn; erratic
birds, which change their place merely in search of food, may
be taken, some in winter, some in spring, and others in
autumn; those birds which never quit their native place may
be taken at any season, but more easily in winter, when they
assemble in small flocks.</p>

<p>Autumn is the time for taking birds in nets; some, attracted
by a call-bird, or by food, come of their own accord into the
trap; others, as the different species of larks, must be driven
to the net; but spring is the best season for employing the
decoy, or call-birds, concealed in cages, and also for catching<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
the northern birds on their return from the southern countries
to their own. It is the best time for observing the different
sexes of these birds, for the males always arrive some days, or
even a whole week, sooner than the females; hence it happens
that at first the bird catchers take only the former, while the
latter are caught afterwards. March and April are the best
months for this sport, which should always be made in the
morning from the break of day till nine o&#8217;clock, as afterwards
the birds are too much engaged seeking their food to listen to
the call of the decoy birds.</p>

<p>As most of the house birds of the first class, are caught in
the net, I shall describe the simple manner in which it is done
in Thuringia. Some rather strong branches of oak and beech
are chosen with their leaves on; about the space of a foot is
cleared of leaves, a foot and a half from the top of the branches,
and in this space notches are made for fixing lime twigs: the
bush, when thus prepared, must be placed on an eminence in
the most frequented part of the birds&#8217; path, for birds of
passage have fixed roads which they always follow, and in
which numbers may be seen, whilst about four hundred paces
distant not one can be met with. These tracks generally
follow the mountains which border on valleys. It is on these
mountains then that the decoy bush must be placed; it must
then be garnished with lime twigs, placed in an inclined
position, and beneath on the ground must be put the decoy
birds, covering their cages with branches of fir or any other
tree, so that the birds cannot see one another, as that would
prevent the birds of passage from stopping, and the others
from calling.</p>

<p>Decoy birds taken wild are preferred to those reared from
the nest, for these never know the call note well, or at least
do not repeat it often enough.</p>

<p>One of the best modes of catching is by what is called the
<i>water-trap</i>; all kinds of birds may be caught by it, and there
is always a choice. This sport is very agreeable in the hot
summer days, for you have only to sit quietly under the thick
shade of the foliage by the side of a running stream. A net
of three, four, or six feet long, and three or four wide, according
to the size of the place, must be spread over a trench made
on purpose to receive the water. Some sticks of about an
inch thick must be put into the trench level with the water,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
to which hoops are fixed to prevent the net from getting wet
by falling into the water; the rest of this little canal must be
covered with branches. If the place be well chosen it will
be surrounded during the day with numbers of different birds.
This sport may be carried on from the 24th of July till October,
from the rising to the setting of the sun.</p>

<p>When the <i>water-trap</i> can be set near a forest, in a grove of
pines and firs, near quickset hedges and gardens, or in the
middle of a meadow, wood or field-birds may be caught at
the same time. For the sake of convenience, small cages are
made which can be folded up and put into the pocket. They
only serve, however, for the tamest kinds of birds, such as
goldfinches, siskins, and linnets; those which are very wild
and violent, as chaffinches and larks, should be put into a
small bag made of linen, the bottom of which must be lined
with felt. When brought to the house the violent species
must be immediately put into a dark place, and their cages
covered with branches or anything else, that they may not
injure themselves, or spoil their plumage. A little attention
to the birds&#8217; actions in such cases will point out what is best
to be done, for amongst birds of the same species there is
nothing regular in this respect.</p>

<h3>BIRDS OF PREY.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Birds</span> of prey are so called from feeding only on animals:
they have a hooked beak, strong feet, and very sharp claws.</p>

<p>Some birds of this group are used in falconry, so called
because several species of falcon are employed in the sport:
others, as the owls, are used to attract small birds to the barn-floor
trap, and rooks to the decoy-hut. There seems little
probability that bird-fanciers should wish to keep such birds
as these in the house. Two species, however, appear to merit
distinction, the kestril and the little owl.</p>

<hr />

<h4>THE KESTRIL.</h4>

<p class="center">Falco Tinnunculus, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; La Cresserelle, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Der Thurmfalke,
<span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Its</span> size is that of a turtle-dove, its length fourteen inches,
including the tail, which measures six, and two-thirds of which
is covered by the folded wings. The wax, the irides, and feet
are yellow. In general this is a handsome bird; but the
male, as in all birds of prey, differs from the female, not less
in the body being a third smaller than in the colours of his
plumage. The top of the head is of a fine light grey, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
back and the lesser wing coverts are of a red brick colour
spotted with black; the belly is reddish, and streaked with
black; the feathers of the tail dark brown spotted with white,
ending in a broad black border.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><img src="images/i_040.png" alt="THE KESTRIL." title="THE KESTRIL." height="389" width="500" />
</div>

<p>The back and wings of the female are of a rust red crossed
with many black lines; the head is of a light reddish brown
streaked with black; the tail of the same colour, and terminated,
like that of the male, with a broad black border; the
extremity, however, of each is pale<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">13</a>.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Habitation.</span>&mdash;In its wild state the kestril falcon may be found
throughout Europe, preferring mountainous places, where there are walls
of rocks or ruined castles. It is a bird of passage, which departs in
October with the larks, and may then be seen hovering over them, or
pouncing at mice; it returns in the following March.</p>

<p>In the house, if taken when old, it must be kept in a wire cage; but
if caught and trained when young it may be left quite at liberty, provided
its wings are kept clipped; in that case it will neither quit the house nor
lodging assigned it, especially when become familiar with the dogs and cats.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Food.</span>&mdash;In its wild state it preys on small birds and mice, pursues
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>sparrows to the house-top, and even attacks birds in their cages; it is
nevertheless contented with cockchafers, beetles, and grasshoppers.</p>

<p>In confinement it is fed on birds, mice, and a little raw meat; when
given only the fresh offal of pigeons, or the lights and livers of sheep,
it becomes so tame, that even if taken when old it never appears to regret
the loss of its freedom.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Breeding.</span>&mdash;The kestril falcon builds its nest in the fissures of rooks,
high towers, old castles, or some aged tree. It lays from four to six eggs
of a reddish yellow colour, spotted with red and brown. The young ones,
which are at first covered with a simple white down, may be easily reared
on fresh mutton.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mode of Taking.</span>&mdash;Lime twigs placed over the nest will easily secure
the old ones when they come to feed their young; or a bird of prey&#8217;y
basket, with a lark or mouse put in it as a lure, may be placed where
these birds are most frequently seen. This machine is raised on four
stakes, and somewhat resembles a common safe, having a lower shelf as
large as a moderate sized table, with four upright posts, to which are
fastened the partitions of net or wire; on the top and sides are fixed two
iron rods; on these, by means of rings, there runs a net which covers
the whole.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attractive Qualities.</span>&mdash;Its fine plumage, its sonorous notes <i>kle</i>, <i>kle</i>,
which it sometimes repeats in continued succession, and its amusing
actions, must make it a favourite with most amateurs; it cannot, indeed,
like other species of falcon, be trained to the chase; but if taken when
very young, and fed with the food before mentioned, it may be taught to
fly to some distance and then return, even in the midst of the largest
cities.</p></div>

<hr />

<h4>THE LITTLE OWL.</h4>

<p class="center">Strix passerina, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; La Chev&egrave;che, ou Petite Chouette, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Die
Zwergeule, <span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> feathers of this bird make it appear larger than it really
is. Its length is from eight to nine inches, of which the tail
measures at least three; the folded wings almost reach the
extremity; the beak is ten lines in length, brown at the base,
and yellow at the point; the iris is yellow in summer, and
meadow green in winter; the claws blackish; the upper part
of the body is light brown, with round white spots, which are
largest on the back and shoulders; the lower part is white,
spotted with dark brown and a little orange; the quill feathers
dark brown, with white spots; the tail lighter, with red spots,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
which may almost be taken for transverse bands. The colours
are less brilliant in the female.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Habitation.</span>&mdash;In its wild state this small species of owl frequents old
buildings, towers, and church walls, where its nest is also found<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">14</a>.</p>

<p>In the house it must always be kept in a cage, which may be hung in
the window, for if permitted to mix with the other birds it would kill
them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Food.</span>&mdash;When wild its general food is mice and large insects; I have
also found in the indigested remains which this, like other birds of prey,
discharges from its stomach, a considerable quantity of the fruit of the red
cornel tree (<i>Cornus sanguinea</i>, Linn&aelig;us). This proves that it also feeds
on berries.</p>

<p>In the cage it may be kept for some time in good health, without having
its excrements tainted, if fed on dried mutton: the skin, fat, and bones
must be removed, and the meat left to soak in water for two days before
it is eaten. Three quarters of an ounce a day of this meat dried will be
sufficient, particularly if now and then some mice or birds be given it,
which it swallows, feathers and all; it can devour as many as five mice
at a meal. It begins to wake up at about two in the afternoon, and then
becomes very lively, and soon wants its food.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Breeding.</span>&mdash;The female lays two white eggs, which the male takes his
turn to sit upon; the young ones may be very easily reared on fresh meat,
particularly on pigeons. Before the first moulting the head is of a soft
reddish grey clouded with white. The large round spots on the back
become gradually more marked, and the reddish white of the under part
by degrees acquires long streaks of brown on the breast and sides.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diseases.</span>&mdash;If great care be not taken sometimes to give it mice or birds,
the fur and feathers of which cleanse the stomach, it will soon die of
decline.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mode of Taking.</span>&mdash;When the place of its retreat during the day is
discovered, it cannot fail to be taken if a net in the form of a bag or sack
be placed over the mouth of the hole, for the bird will by this means
entrap itself when endeavouring to come out for the evening.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attractive Qualities.</span>&mdash;This bird, which is very cleanly, always
deposits its dung in one particular spot. Its singular motions are amusing,
but its harsh cry, and restlessness, particularly during the season of copulation,
are rather disagreeable. It is much used on the continent as a
decoy, to entrap small birds.</p></div>

<h3>PIES.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> birds of this group have the beak a little flat, more or
less hooked, generally in the form of a knife, and of a middling
size. The feet are in general strong and short; the lower
part, being much divided, may be used for walking or climbing.
Their food consists of insects, worms, the flesh and remains of
animals, seeds and fruit. In a few species the note is pleasing;
several may be taught to speak; and some are admired for
their handsome plumage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is a little larger than the Redwing (<i>Turdus Iliacus</i>,
Linn.) Its length is nine inches, of which the tail measures
three and three-quarters; the wings, when folded, cover one-third

is very dark brown; the shanks iron grey. All the upper

The tail is wedge-shaped, white at the point, and black in
the middle.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Habitation.</span>&mdash;When wild, this species generally frequents groves,
thickets, and the borders of forests; it is also found among brambles,
and on lonely trees, always perched on the top. It never quits the abode
it has once chosen, either in winter or summer. When caught it must
be kept in a large wire cage. Its liveliness and desire for prey prevent its
being permitted to mix with the other birds.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Food.</span>&mdash;In its wild state, it feeds in summer on grasshoppers, crickets,
beetles, and other insects, even lizards, and small adders, and when those
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>fail, on mice and small birds; these, with mice, moles, and the like, form
its winter food. When pursuing its prey, the shrike makes a particular
movement, in order to seize it on the side; but it does not always succeed,
as it cannot use its claws like birds of prey, and often only carries off a
beakful of feathers.</p>

<p>In the cage, if the bird be taken when old, some mice, birds, or living
insects, may be thrown to it, taking care to leave it quite alone, for as
long as any one is present it will touch nothing; but as soon as it has
once begun to feed freely it will eat fresh meat, and even become accustomed
to the universal paste, described in the Introduction. This shrike
eats very much for its size, at the least one ounce of meat at a meal. It
likes to have a forked branch, or crossed sticks in its cage, across the
angles of which it throws the mouse, or any other prey which has been
given it, and then darting on it behind from the opposite side of the cage,
devours every morsel, let it be ever so large. It bathes freely.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mode of Taking.</span>&mdash;Although it flies very swiftly when pursuing its
prey, it may easily be taken if a nest of young birds, crying from hunger,
be suspended to some lime twigs. In autumn and winter, it will sometimes
dart on birds in cages which are outside the window. It may then
be easily caught, if the cage be put into a sort of box, having the lid so
placed that the bird by the least touch would cause it to fall upon itself.
These means must be employed by those who wish to possess birds which
they can let go and come at will.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attractive Qualities.</span>&mdash;Its cry somewhat resembles the <i>guir, guir</i>
of the lark; like the nutcracker, it can imitate the different notes, but not
the songs, of other birds. Nothing is more agreeable than its own
warbling, which much resembles the whistling of the grey parrot; its
throat at the time being expanded like that of the green frog. It is a
great pity that it only sings during the pairing season, which is from
March to May, and even then often spoils the beautiful melody of its
song, with some harsh, discordant notes. The female also sings. As
some of its tones resemble the human voice, it might probably be taught
to speak.</p></div>

<h4>THE LITTLE SHRIKE.</h4>

<p class="center">Lanius minor, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; Der graue W&uuml;rger, <span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is about the size of the sky-lark, being eight inches in
length, of which the tail measures three and a half, the folded
wings cover one-third. The beak is black, and seven inches
in length; the iris brown; the legs of a lead-colour; the
forehead black; a broad streak of the same colour passing
from the beak across the eyes and over the cheeks; the tail is
wedge-shaped; the exterior feathers are white, with a black
spot.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span></p>

<p>The female only differs from the male in being a little
smaller, the streak on the cheeks is shorter and narrower, and
there is generally only one white feather in the tail.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Habitation.</span>&mdash;Wild, it is a bird of passage, departing the first of
September, and returning the beginning of the following May<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">15</a>. It
generally frequents woods, orchards, and the hedges of fields. Always
perched on the tops of trees, it rarely descends into the lower bushes. It
feeds on insects.</p>

<p>In the house, it must have a large wire cage like the larks, but with
three perches. It is not safe to let it mix with the other birds, as it would
soon kill them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Food.</span>&mdash;In its wild state it feeds on beetles, cockchafers, crickets,
breeze-flies, and other insects; when these fail, in consequence of a long
continuance of rain, it sometimes seizes young birds.</p>

<p>In the house, if an old bird and lately taken, as soon as it is put in the
cage, some living insects, or a small bird just killed, must be thrown into
it. After some time, it will be satisfied with raw or dressed meat; but it
is not always an easy task to get it to eat this food, for it will sometimes
take eight successive days, during which meal worms and other insects are
added; but as soon as it is accustomed to meat, it becomes so tame that
it will feed from the hand, and if the cage door be opened it will even
perch on the wrist to eat. Notwithstanding all my care, I have only been
able to preserve those two years, which have been taken wild, they have
all died of decline<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">16</a>; those, on the contrary, which have been reared from
the nest, do not require so much attention, being contented with any kind
of common food.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Breeding.</span>&mdash;This bird generally builds in a tree on the edge of a wood,
or in a garden, the nest being rather large and irregular. The young are
fed on beetles and grasshoppers. In order to rear them, they must be
taken from the nest when the tail begins to grow, and fed at first on ants'
eggs, and afterwards on white bread soaked in milk.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mode of Taking.</span>&mdash;When the particular brambles and branches have
been observed, on which this bird watches for its prey, it is not difficult
to catch it; for notwithstanding its great quickness, it is not the less
imprudent, for it allows itself to be caught in the bird-lime in the most
stupid manner.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attractive Qualities.</span>&mdash;This species has no particular song: the
female has none at all; but the male imitates, with wonderful facility,
the songs of other birds, not only the detached parts, but the whole notes,
so correctly that it would not be difficult to mistake it. Thus it imitates
exactly, and in order, all the variations of the song of the nightingale,
though more feebly, and like an echo, its notes not being so full and
clear: it imitates equally well the song of the lark, and similar birds.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>This wonderful power of imitation cannot fail to please amateurs, and
make them wish to possess this interesting bird. I have observed that it
likes best to repeat the call of the quail. One of this species which I had
among my collection, always stopped its song, however lively, when it
heard that of the quail, for the purpose of imitating it; the latter, before
it was accustomed to this, became very jealous, and as soon as it heard it,
ran about in every direction, furiously endeavouring to fight its fancied
rival.</p></div>

<hr />

<h4>THE WOODCHAT.</h4>

<p class="center">Lanius erythrocephalus. Lan. Collurio, rufus, et pomeranus, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; La Pie
Gri&egrave;che rousse, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Der rothk&ouml;pfige W&uuml;rger, <span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> is smaller and more delicate than the former species,
being only seven inches long, of which the tail measures three
and a half; the folding wings cover one third; the beak is
eight lines in length, and black; the iris greyish yellow; the
shanks bluish black; the forehead black, from the base of
which a band of the same colour extends over the eyes. The
tail feathers are also black, but the outer ones only so to the
middle, the rest being white.</p>

<p>The female only differs from the male in its colour being
less brilliant.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Habitation.</span>&mdash;When wild it is a bird of passage, arriving at the end of
April, and departing about the middle of September<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">17</a>. It inhabits mountains,
forests, and wooded plains, but prefers enclosed pastures where horses
are kept day and night.</p>

<p>In confinement it requires the same treatment as the preceding.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Food.</span>&mdash;In its wild state it prefers beetles, the dung of cows and horses,
maybugs, grasshoppers, breeze-flies, and other insects; it often also darts
upon lizards and young quails.</p>

<p>In a state of confinement it is fed like the preceding; but being more
delicate it is better to rear it from the nest, feeding it on raw meat. If
an old bird be taken, it is impossible to preserve it unless it be constantly
fed on live insects.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Breeding.</span>&mdash;The woodchat commonly builds its nest on the thick and
bushy branches of large trees, and makes it of small sticks, moss, hogs'
bristles, wool and fur. The female breeds twice, laying each time six
reddish-white eggs, marked particularly at the large end with distinct red
spots, mixed with pale ones of a bluish grey. The young ones are hatched
in fifteen days; their colour, before the first moulting, is on the upper
part, dirty white, spotted with grey; the under part is also dirty white,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>clouded with pale grey; the wing coverts are bordered with rust colour;
the quill feathers and tail are black.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mode of Taking.</span>&mdash;A cruel method, but the surest, is to place bird-lime
on its nest, this being the most wary species of shrike; but as it
bathes freely it may be taken about the middle of the day at its washing
place, if near hedges. It is often found drowned in large ponds.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attractive Qualities.</span>&mdash;Although this species appears endowed with
as good a memory as the preceding, its notes are less agreeable, not being
so soft, and it introduces some stanzas of its own shrill and harsh warbling
into the songs that it imitates, which are those of the nightingale, linnet,
redstart, and goldfinch. But this bird is most admired for its beautiful
plumage.</p></div>

<h4>THE FLUSHER.</h4>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;"><img src="images/i_047.png" alt="THE FLUSHER." title="" height="210" width="250" />
</div>

<p class="center">Lanius spinitorquus, <span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>; Lanius Collurio, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; L&#8217;Lcorcheur,
<span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Der rothr&uuml;ckige W&uuml;rger, <span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> pretty species seems to form a connecting link between
the pies and the singing birds, so much does it resemble the
latter in its different qualities. Its length is a little more
than six inches, of which the tail measures three and a quarter.
The wings, when folded, cover one third. The beak is black,
and the iris of the eyes light brown; the legs, bluish black.</p>

<p>In the male, the head, the nape of the neck, the tail coverts,
and the thighs, are grey. This colour is lighter on the forehead
and above the eyes. A black band extends from the
nostrils to the ears. The beak and wing coverts are of a fine
red brown; the rump and under part of the body white,
slightly tinged with pink on the breast, sides, and belly; the
centre tail feathers are entirely black, the others white at the
tip.</p>

<p>The colours in the female differ considerably from those of
the male. All the upper part of the body is dirty reddish<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
brown, slightly shading into grey on the upper part of the neck
and rump; there is a scarcely visible shade of white on the
back and shoulders; the forehead and above the eyes is yellowish,
the cheeks brown, the throat and belly dirty white; the
under parts of the neck, breast, and sides, are yellowish white,
crossed with waving brown lines; the quill feathers are dark
brown, the outer ones edged with white, the others to the four
centre ones have only a white spot; the tail dark brown, with
some shades of orange.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Habitation.</span>&mdash;When wild it is one of the latest birds of passage, as it
does not arrive till May. It is sometimes found in woody valleys where
cattle graze, more commonly in hedges, and fields with bushes in them, or
in inclosed pastures where horses and cows are kept. It is one of the first
migratory birds to depart, which it does in August, in families, even before
the young ones have moulted.</p>

<p>In the house, it must be treated like the former, and kept in a wire
cage, for it would soon kill its companions, as I experienced some years
ago. The bird I refer to had been three days without eating, although I had
given him a great variety of dead birds and insects. On the fourth day I
set him at liberty in the room, supposing him too weak to hurt the other
birds, and thinking that he would become better accustomed to his new
food if I left him at liberty. Hardly was he set free than he seized and
killed a dunnock before I had time to save it; I let him eat it, and then
put him back into the cage. From this time, as if his fury were satisfied,
he ate all that was given him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Food.</span>&mdash;In its wild state, it eats large quantities of beetles, maybugs,
crickets, and grasshoppers, but it prefers breeze-flies, and other insects
which teaze the cattle. It impales as many of these insects as it can catch
for its meal on the thorns of bushes. If, during a long continuance of
rain, these insects disappear, it then feeds on field-mice, lizards, and young
birds, which it also fixes on the thorns.</p>

<p>When confined, its food is the same as the preceding species. Some insects,
mixed with the nightingales&#8217; paste, make it more palatable for it. A
little raw or dressed meat may also be given it from time to time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Breeding.</span>&mdash;When the season is favourable this species breeds twice,
and generally chooses a large hawthorn bush in which to build its nest, roots
and coarse stubble forming the base of it, then a layer of moss interwoven
with wool, and the finest fibres of roots lining the interior. The female
lays from five to six greenish white eggs, spotted all over, especially at the
large end, and speckled with red and grey; the male takes his turn with
the female to sit during fourteen days. Before moulting, the young ones
resemble the female in colour. The back and breast are greenish grey,
streaked with several waving brown lines; the belly is dirty white. They
can be easily reared by feeding them at first with ants&#8217; eggs, then with
dressed meat, and afterwards with white bread soaked in milk: this last
food it always likes if early accustomed to it.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mode of Taking.</span>&mdash;As soon as this bird arrives in May, the bushes on
which it most frequently perches must be observed; these are very few,
and on them the lime twigs must be placed; it is often entrapped within a
quarter of an hour. Success is more certain if a beetle, maybug, or
breeze-fly, be fastened near the lime twigs with horse hair, by two feet, so
that it can move its wings. As soon as the bird is stuck in the bird-lime
it is necessary when taking it to avoid its beak, as it pecks very hard.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attractive Qualities.</span>&mdash;This bird does not rank low among the singers;
its song is not only very pleasing but continual. While singing, it is
generally perched on a lonely bush, or on the lower branches of a tree, but
always near its nest. Its warbling is composed of the songs of the swallow,
goldfinch, fauvette, nightingale, red-breast, and lark, with which, indeed, it
mixes here and there some of its own harsh notes. It almost exclusively
imitates the birds in its immediate neighbourhood; it very rarely repeats
the song or call of those which merely fly past it; when it does, it seems
only in mockery. There are, however, some songs which it cannot
imitate: for instance, that of the chaffinch and yellowhammer, its throat
not seeming to be sufficiently flexible for these. In the house, its song is
composed of the warbling of those birds whose cages are hung near it. It
is very lively, and its plumage is handsome.</p>

<p>If a room is to be cleared of flies, one of these birds set at liberty in it
will soon effect it; it catches them flying with great skill and agility.
When a thorny branch is given it, it impales all its flies, making at the
same time the drollest and most singular movements. This species easily
and quickly learns to whistle airs, but it forgets them with the same
facility, in order to learn new ones.</p></div>

<h4>THE RAVEN.</h4>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;"><img src="images/i_049.png" alt="THE RAVEN." title="" height="184" width="250" />
</div>

<p class="center">Corvus Corax, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; Le Corbeau, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Der Kolkrabe, <span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> and the three following species ought not to be reckoned
among house birds; but as they are easily taught to speak, and
are often reared for that purpose, I must not neglect to mention
them here.</p>

<p>The raven is well known. Its length is two feet, of which
the tail measures eight inches and three quarters. The colour,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
which is black, in particular lights reflects a violet tint on the
upper, and green on the lower part of the body, of the wings
and tail. The throat is of a paler black.</p>

<p>Of all the birds of this genus, distinguished by having the
beak in the form of a knife, and the base furnished with strong
bristles which extend forward, the raven, on account of the size
of its tongue, is the best fitted to articulate words; hence, in
Thuringia, people are often saluted, on entering an inn, with
some abusive language from one of these ravens, confined near
the door, in a large cage like a tower. When it has been reared
from the nest (which must be done in order to teach it to speak)
it may be left at liberty; it will come when called by name to
receive its food. Everything which shines must be put out of
its way, particularly gold and silver, as it does not fail to carry
it off, like the other birds of its kind. One, which was brought
before Augustus, had been taught to repeat, <i>Ave C&aelig;sar, victor,
imperator</i>, in order to salute him on his return from victory.</p>

<p>Some people are accustomed to cut what is called the nerve
of the tongue, supposing that it would make them better able
to articulate sounds; but it seems most probable that this cruel
practice is of little use, and, like many others, only a vulgar
prejudice, for I have heard ravens speak perfectly well without
having the tongue touched.</p>

<p>This bird was very much prized at a time when divination
made a part of religion. Its most minute actions, all the
motions of its flight, and the different sounds of its voice, were
carefully studied; in the latter, people pretending to discover
even sixty-four different modulations, besides many shades still
more delicate and difficult to determine. This must certainly
have required an excessively fine ear, as its croaking is particularly
simple. Every alteration, let it be ever so slight, had
its particular signification. Impostors were not wanting, who
pretended to understand, or dupes who easily believed, these
idle fancies. Some have carried their folly to such a pitch as
to persuade themselves that by eating the heart and entrails of
the raven they would acquire its gift of prophecy.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Habitation.</span>&mdash;This species only inhabits the wooded parts of a country;
it there builds its nest on the highest trees. Its eggs, from three to five in
number, are of a dirty green, streaked with olive brown. If the young
ones be taken in order to instruct them, they must be removed on the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>twelfth day after bursting the shell, when they have only half their feathers.
They are fed on meat, snails, worms, and bread soaked in milk; after a
little time they will eat bread, meat, and any refuse from the table. In its
wild state the raven eats leverets, birds&#8217; eggs, mice, young goslings,
chickens, and snails, and even pears, cherries, and other fruit; this shows
us that it is rather hurtful as well as useful.</p></div>

<hr />

<h4>THE CARRION CROW.</h4>

<p class="center">Corvus corone, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; La Corneille, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Die Schwarze Kr&auml;he,
<span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> only differs from the preceding in its size, and in the tail
being rounded instead of wedge-shaped. Its whole length is
eighteen inches. Its plumage is black, with some tints of
violet on the upper part of the body.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Peculiar Qualities.</span>&mdash;The carrion crow is one of the commonest birds;
in the groves, which it likes best, it congregates in such numbers that
twenty nests have been built on the same tree<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">18</a>; the eggs are spotted
with grey or olive brown on a green ground. The young may be taken
from the nest in the month of March, or even earlier if the winter be mild
they are treated and fed like the former species. The carrion crow is even
more easily tamed, for I have seen old ones, which have been taught to go
and come, and others in their wild state, which have regularly fed in the
yard going in the spring to breed in the woods, and returning at the
beginning of the winter to pass that season in a domestic state. Insects,
worms, mice, fruit, and grain form its principal food in its wild state.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mode of Taking.</span>&mdash;The easiest and most usual method is with paper
cones, at the bottom of which is put a bit of meat, and bird-lime on the
inner edges. It may also be caught with lime twigs placed in the yard, or
before the house, on horse dung and among scattered grain.</p></div>

<hr />

<h4>THE HOODED CROW.</h4>

<p class="center">Corvus Cornix, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; La Corneille Mantel&eacute;e, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Die Nebelkr&auml;he,
<span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> species, a little larger than the preceding, is grey, with
the head, throat, wings, and tail black. In the winter it is
found over almost all Europe, but during summer it inhabits
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>more northern parts, where it builds in groves and orchards
near open fields: its eggs are bright green streaked and spotted
with brown.</p>

<p>If taken young it is tamed and taught to speak more easily
than the carrion crow.</p>

<hr />

<h4>THE JACK-DAW.</h4>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;"><img src="images/i_052.png" alt="THE JACK-DAW." title="" height="191" width="250" /></div>

<p class="center">Corvus Monedula, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; Le Chocas, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Die Dohle, <span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> bird is naturally half tame, and if reared from the nest
it will voluntarily remain in the yard with the poultry. It
makes its nest in old buildings, houses, castles, towers, and
churches: its eggs are green, spotted with dark brown and
black. It is not so much to teach it to speak that people like
to rear young jack-daws, but to see it go and return at call.
Even old ones that are taken in autumn may be accustomed
to this, cutting the wings at first, and again in the spring, so
that as they grow again the bird learns by degrees to come to
a certain call. During winter it will always come into the
yard. The size of the jack-daw is that of the pigeon, thirteen
or fourteen inches in length. The back of the head is light grey,
the rest of the body black. When in winter it eats wild garlic,
in the fields it smells very strongly of it, and does not lose the
scent till it has been a week in the house.</p>

<h4>THE JAY.</h4>

<p class="center">Corvus glandarius, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; Le Geai, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Der Holzeher, <span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I</span> have often, during my youth, seen this beautiful species
of bird among the peasants of Thuringia confined in cages, and
taught to speak. It is about the size of the preceding bird. Its
black beak is in shape like that of the carrion crow. The feet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
are brown, with a slight shade of flesh colour. All the smaller
feathers are soft and silky. A purple grey is the most predominant
colour; the throat is whitish, the eyes are reddish blue, the
rump white; the large coverts have the outer side of the
feathers ornamented with small but very brilliant bands, alternately
bluish white, light blue, and bluish black, which softly
blend one into the other, like the colours in the rainbow, and
are a great ornament to the bird.</p>

<p>The only difference in the female is that the upper part of
the neck is grey, whereas in the male it is much redder, and
that colour also extends to the back.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Habitation.</span>&mdash;When wild, the jay frequents woods; above all, those
in which there are firs mixed with other trees.</p>

<p>In the house it must be kept in a large cage in the form of a tower, or
in any other shape; it is too dirty a bird to be let range at liberty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Food.</span>&mdash;In its wild state it prefers worms, insects, and berries, when
acorns and beech-mast fail: it makes great havoc among cherries.</p>

<p>In the cage, it soon becomes accustomed to bread soaked in milk, but it
will eat almost any thing, bread, soft cheese, baked meat, and all that
comes from table; acorns and beech-mast however are its favourite food.
It must be kept very clean, otherwise its soiled and dirty plumage would
make it look to great disadvantage. It is better to feed it entirely on
corn; it becomes by this means less dirty, and its excrements are not so
soft or f&oelig;tid. It may be preserved for several years on this food. It must
always have fresh water given it, as much for drinking as for bathing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Breeding.</span>&mdash;The jay builds in beech-trees, oaks, and firs. Its eggs are
grey spotted with brown. The young which are to be taught to speak
must be taken from the nest after the fourteenth or fifteenth day, and fed
on soft cheese, bread, and meat: it is easily taught and domesticated.
Those which are caught when old cannot be tamed; they are always
frightened when any one approaches them, hiding and fasting for several
hours afterwards rather then reappear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mode of Taking.</span>&mdash;Should anyone wish to catch these birds, he must seek
in autumn for a lonely tree, about five or six paces from the other trees of the
wood, which the birds frequent most; on it lime twigs must be placed. In
order to effect this, most of the branches are cut off in such a manner as to
form a kind of spiral staircase, commencing about ten or twelve feet from the
ground, and extending to within six of the top. After having shortened and
reduced the branches to five or six spans in length, the lime-twigs are fixed
to them; under the tree must be placed a hut, made of green branches, large
enough to contain as many persons as wish to conceal themselves; on the
top of this hut is placed a live owl, or one made of clay; even the skin of
a hare arranged so that it may be moved, will suffice. Nothing is now
wanting to attract the jays but a bird-call, which is made of a little stick
with a notch cut in it and a little piece of the bark of the cherry-tree inserted,
another bit serving for a cover. On this instrument the voice of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>the owl, the great enemy of the jays, may easily be imitated; and as soon
as they hear it they come from all sides, while their cries must be repeated
by the people in the hut, which makes them assemble in still greater
numbers. They are soon entangled in the bird-lime, and fall pell mell
into the hut, their weight easily dragging them through the slight covering.
Many other birds also collect on hearing the deceitful call, and, wishing to
assist their brethren, are themselves entrapped. Thus, in a few hours
many jays and a great number of other birds may be caught, such as magpies,
thrushes, woodpeckers, red-breasts, and tits. Twilight is the best
time for this sport.</p>

<p>In the month of July jays may also be taken in the <i>water-trap</i>, where
young ones, with their tails only half grown, are most frequently caught;
these may yet be taught and tamed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attractive Qualities.</span>&mdash;Although it is easy to teach the jay to speak,
it will in general only repeat single words; but it imitates passably well
little airs on the trumpet and other short tunes. Its beautiful colours are
a great attraction. It may also be taught to go and come, if in the
country: but in the city it is not so easily taught this as crows and ravens.</p></div>

<h4>THE NUT-CRACKER.</h4>

<p class="center">Corvus Caryocatactes, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; Le Casse-noix, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Der Tannenbeher,
<span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Its</span> length is twelve inches, of which the tail measures four
and three quarters; the wings, when folded, reach the middle.
The beak and feet are black; the iris is reddish brown.
Though speckled like the starling, its general colour is blackish
brown, lighter above, and darker underneath the body. The
tail feathers are black, but white at the tip.</p>

<p>The general colour of the female is a redder brown than that
of the male.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Habitation.</span>&mdash;In its wild state it inhabits, during summer, the depth of
woods, near which there are meadows and springs, and it does not quit this
retreat till autumn, when it frequents those places where it can find acorns,
beech-mast, and nuts. During hard winters it may sometimes be seen on
the high road, seeking its food amongst the horse-dung.</p>

<p>In the house it is kept like a jay.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Food.</span>&mdash;In its wild state, having a very strong beak, it can open the
cones of the pine and fir, peel the acorns and beech-mast, and break the
nut-shells. It also eats different sorts of berries, but prefers animal food
and insects, in short, any thing it can get.</p>

<p>In confinement it must be fed like the jay; but it is more easily tamed,
and accustomed to use different words. It is so fond of animal food, that
if a live jay were thrown into its cage it would kill it and eat it in a
quarter of an hour; it will even eat whole squirrels which have been shot,
and which other small birds of prey fly from with disgust.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Breeding.</span>&mdash;Its nest, placed in a hollow tree, generally contains five or
six eggs, with transverse brown streaks scattered on a dark olive grey
ground. The young are reared on meat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mode of Taking.</span>&mdash;It may be taken in autumn by a noose, hanging
service berries to it; success is more sure if some nuts be put near. It
may also be taken in the <i>water-trap</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attractive Qualities.</span>&mdash;Its actions are as amusing as those of a
shrike; it imitates the voice of many animals, and chatters as much as
the jay. To judge from the form of its tongue, it seems possible to teach
it to speak, if attempted when young.</p></div>

<h4>THE MAGPIE.</h4>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;"><img src="images/i_055.png" alt="THE MAGPIE." title="" height="175" width="250" /></div>

<p class="center">Corvus Pica, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; La Pie, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Die Elster, <span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> the magpie generally frequents places near the abode of
man, it is well known. It is eighteen inches in length, of
which the tail alone measures ten. It may be called a handsome
bird, although its plumage is only black and white, for
these colours are perfect in their kind, and the tail, near the
end, shines with a purple tint, gradually shading into steel
blue.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Habitation.</span>&mdash;The magpie builds its nest on trees which are near towns
and villages; its eggs are pale green, speckled with grey and brown. In
autumn the young ones assemble together in small parties.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Food.</span>&mdash;When wild, the magpie lives on worms, insects, fruits, or roots,
and sometimes eats eggs and young birds in their nest.</p>

<p>In the house, it likes bread, meat, and anything that comes from table;
in short, when once tamed it does not fail to enter by the window at meal
times to take its share. If it obtain too much, it hides what it does not eat
for another time. This propensity is seen in young ones as soon as they
can feed alone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peculiar Qualities.</span>&mdash;Although in its wild state the magpie is so suspicious
that it is difficult to catch it, it is, however, more easily tamed
than any other bird; it will let itself be touched and taken in the hand,
which even the most docile of other birds will seldom suffer. When
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>reared from the nest it learns to speak even better than the raven, and
becomes as domestic as the pigeon. It gets so fond of raw meat, bread,
and other refuse of the table, that it does not wish any other food; this
is the cause of its frequenting dwelling-houses: if it find any worms or
insects it only eats them as dainties.</p>

<p>The time of taking magpies in order to bring them to this point is
fourteen or fifteen days after coming out of the shell: this is the principal
thing to remember with respect to any bird which is to be taught to go
and come. It must be given at first bread soaked in milk or water; by
degrees a little chopped meat is added, afterwards it will eat anything from
the kitchen, even apples and baked pears, and any refuse. As soon as the
young birds begin to fly high enough to rise to a neighbouring tree they
may be let do so when they have had a good meal, soon calling them back
again to the place fixed for their habitation; this practice may be repeated
till they have all their feathers, and can fly well, when some of their
wing-feathers must be cut, till the winter, a season in which they may be
pulled out. Whilst the feathers are growing again, they become so well
accustomed to the house and their master that they may be let go for
several hours together without any danger of their wandering or not
returning. If they speak they will only be the more agreeable.</p>

<p>Old magpies, which may easily be taken in winter with lime-twigs
placed near some bits of meat, can be taught to remain in the yard by
keeping the wings cut till the following autumn, when they may be let
grow; from this time there is no fear of their not coming with the poultry,
and in spring they will not fail to build near the house, and seek food for
their young in the kitchen. I must repeat again that nothing shining
must be left in the way of these birds, as they will carry it off immediately,
and hide it with great care, let them have as much food as
they like besides.</p>

<p>I have lately received a letter from one of my friends, in which he
expresses himself thus:&mdash;&#8220;I have reared a magpie which comes like a
cat to rub itself against me until I caress it. It has learnt of itself to fly
into the country and return. It follows me everywhere, even for more
than a league, so that I have much trouble to rid myself of it, and when
I do not wish its company in my walks and visits I am obliged to shut
it up: though wild with any other person, it marks in my eyes the least
change in my temper. It will sometimes fly to a great distance with other
magpies, without however connecting itself with them.&#8221;</p></div>

<h4>THE ROLLER.</h4>

<p class="center">Coracias Garrula, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; Le Rollier d&#8217;durope, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Die Mandelkr&auml;he,
<span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> bird resembles the jay in size and form, and is twelve
inches in length, of which the tail measures four and a half;
the beak is blackish, before and behind the eyes is a blackish<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
triangular spot, formed by the naked skin; the iris of the eye
is grey; the whole of the head, the neck, the throat, the
breast, the belly, the large wing-coverts, and all the under-coverts,
are of a beautiful bluish green; the tail is of a dusky
blue green near the base, becoming gradually lighter towards
the end.</p>

<p>The female and young ones of the first year have the head,
neck, breast, and belly of a reddish grey tinged with bluish
green; the back and the last quill-feathers are of a light
greyish brown; the rump is green, tinged with indigo; the
tail blackish with a tint of blue green; the rest like the male.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Habitation.</span>&mdash;In its wild state the roller may be found in Europe and
the northern parts of Africa; it only frequents a few spots in Germany,
and prefers forests and sandy plains to high mountains: elsewhere it is
only seen during the time of its passage<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">19</a>.</p>

<p>In the house it may be let range at will after the wings are clipt.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Food.</span>&mdash;When wild, its principal food is insects and worms; it also
eats small frogs, bulbous roots, acorns, and grains of corn.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Breeding.</span>&mdash;The nest, placed in the hole of a tree, is made of small
twigs, hay, feathers, and bristles. It lays from four to seven white eggs,
on which the male takes his turn to sit during eighteen or twenty days.
The young ones do not acquire their fine colours till the second year;
previous to this period the head, neck, and breast are of a whitish grey.</p>

<p>I had till lately thought that this bird was untamable; but Dr. Meyer
of Offenbach has convinced me to the contrary, having himself reared them
several times, and kept them in his room. This is his method:</p>

<p>The young ones must be taken from the nest when only half grown,
and fed on little bits of cow&#8217;s heart, or any other meat which is lean and
tender, till they can eat alone; small frogs, worms, and insects may then
be added. The means which it takes to kill and swallow these insects
are curious enough; it begins by seizing and crushing them with its beak,
and then throws them into the air several times, in order to receive them
in its throat, which is very capacious. When the piece is too large, or
the insect still alive, it strikes it hard against the ground, and begins again
to throw it in the air, till falling not across, but so as to thread the throat,
it may be easily swallowed.</p>

<p>After having been fed thus long enough, a little barley-meal may be
mixed with the meat. I have even brought it to eat bread, vegetables,
and softened oatmeal, but it always prefers cow&#8217;s heart. I have never
seen it drink.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span></p>

<p>It knows the person who takes care of it, comes at his call to eat from
his hands, without however letting itself be caught: but it never becomes
quite tame, and often defends itself with its beak. It makes very few
movements unless to seek its food, and generally remains quite still in the
same place. If it ever hops about the room it is in an awkward and
cramped manner, on account of its short feet; on the other hand, it flies
very well; but it must not be left completely at liberty in the room, or
quite shut up in the cage, because it is so easily startled, and in its fright
gives itself such violent blows on the head as would soon kill it. The
best way is to clip one wing, and then let it range the room. These birds
quarrel with one another, particularly in the evening, for their places on
the perch. I have kept them for some time in a large aviary with small
and great birds, and once with my pigeons which I kept shut up; generally
I have them in my room, where they mix with several other birds: but
whether alone or with companions they appeared equally healthy and
active.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attractive Qualities.</span>&mdash;They have few other attractions besides
their beautiful plumage, for their voice is only a harsh croaking &#8220;<i>crag,
crag, craag</i><a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">20</a>.&#8221;</p></div>

<h4>THE GOLDEN ORIOLE.</h4>

<p class="center">Oriolus Galbula, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; Le Loriot, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Der Pirol, <span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> species, the male of which is very beautiful, is about
the size of a blackbird. Its length is nine inches, of which
the tail measures three and a half, and the beak one. The
head, neck, back, breast, sides, and lesser wing-coverts, are of
a brilliant golden yellow; the wings and the tail are black,
with yellow gradually increasing to the outer feathers.</p>

<p>The female is not so brilliant, the golden yellow is only
visible at the tip of the olive feathers in the tail, and in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>lesser and under wing-coverts. All the upper part of the
body is of the green colour of the siskin, the lower part
greenish white with brown streaks, and the wings grey black.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Habitation.</span>&mdash;When wild, it generally frequents lonely groves, or the
skirts of forests, always keeping among the most bushy trees, so that it is
rarely seen on a naked branch; it always frequents orchards during the
time of cherries. It is a bird of passage, departing in families in August,
and not returning till the following May<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">21</a>.</p>

<p>In the house, if it cannot be let range at pleasure, it must be confined
in a large wire cage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Food.</span>&mdash;When wild, its food is insects and berries. In confinement,
and if an old one be caught by means of the owl, like the jays, it must be
kept at first in a quiet and retired place, offering it fresh cherries, then
adding by degrees ants&#8217; eggs, and white bread soaked in milk, or the
nightingale&#8217;s food. But I confess there is great difficulty in keeping it
alive, for with every attention and the greatest care, I do not know a single
instance of one of this species having been preserved for more than three
or four months.</p>

<p class="caption">NEST OF THE GOLDEN ORIOLE.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Breeding.</span>&mdash;The scarcity of the golden oriole arises from its breeding
but once a year. Its nest, hung with great art in the fork of a small
bushy branch, is in shape like a purse, or a basket with two handles.
The female lays four or five white eggs, marked with a few black streaks
and spots. Before the first moulting, the young ones are like their
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>mother, and mew like cats. If any one wishes to rear them they must
be taken early from the nest; fed on ants&#8217; eggs, chopped meat and white
bread soaked in milk, varying these things as their health requires, and
as their excrements are too frequent or too soft. In short, they may be
accustomed to the nightingale&#8217;s food. I must here remark that a very
attentive person alone can hope to succeed<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">22</a>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attractive Qualities.</span>&mdash;I have seen two golden orioles that were
reared from the nest, one of which, independent of the natural song,
whistled a minuet, and the other imitated a flourish of trumpets. Its full
and flute-like tones appeared to me extremely pleasing. Unfortunately
the fine colours of its plumage were tarnished, which almost always
happens, above all if the bird be kept in a room filled with smoke, either
from the stove or from tobacco. One of my neighbours saw two golden
orioles at Berlin, both of which whistled different airs.</p>

<p>Its note of call, which in the month of June so well distinguishes
the golden oriole from other birds, may be well expressed by &#8220;ye,

<h4>THE HOOPOE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> length of this bird is twelve inches, of which the tail
measures four, and the bill, which is black, two and a half.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span></p><p>The iris is blackish brown. The feet are black and very
short. There is a tuft on the head like a fan, formed of a
double row of feathers, all of them tipped with black.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Habitation.</span>&mdash;In its wild state, the hoopoe remains, during summer,
in woods near meadows, and pasture land. In the month of August,
after hay-harvest, it goes in flocks into the plains; it departs in September,
and does not return till the end of the following April. It is more
frequently seen on the ground than perching<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">24</a>.</p>

<p>In the house, it is not kept in a cage, but let range at will; it is very
chilly, at least it is so fond of warmth that it is constantly on the stove,
and would rather let its beak be dried up than come away from it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Food.</span>&mdash;When wild, it may be continually seen in fields, searching for
its favourite insects among cow dung and the excrements of other animals.
Some people put it into their granaries to clear them of weevils and
spiders; this has succeeded very well, but to say that it also eats mice, is
certainly an error.</p>

<p>In the house, it may be easily reared on meat, and white bread soaked
in milk, to which meal worms must be added from time to time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Breeding.</span>&mdash;The hoopoe lays from two to four eggs; its nest, placed
in the hole of some tree, is a mixture of cow dung and small roots. The
young are easily reared on the flesh of young pigeons; but they cannot
pick it up well, because their tongue, about the size of half a bean, and
heart-shaped, is too short to turn the food into the throat. They
are obliged to throw their food in the air, holding the beak open to
receive it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mode of Taking.</span>&mdash;In the month of August, when a field has been
observed which the bird frequents most, a small well-limed rod of about
eight inches in length must be placed on a mole-hill, having two or three
meal worms fastened to it by means of a thread about three inches long.
As soon as the hoopoe sees the worms it darts upon them, and thus makes
the lime twig fall upon itself, which embarrasses it. But these birds,
whether taken young or old, can very rarely be preserved.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attractive Qualities.</span>&mdash;Independently of its beauty, its droll actions
are very amusing. For instance, it makes a continual motion with its
head, tapping the floor with its beak, so that it seems as if it walks with
a stick, at the same time shaking its crest, wings, and tail<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">25</a>. I have had
several of them in my house, and have always been diverted by their
singular grimaces. When any one looks at them steadily, they immediately
begin their droll tricks.</p>

<p>The following is an extract from a letter written by M. von Schauroth
on the hoopoe, which I think it is well to insert here:</p>

<p>&#8220;With great care and attention, I was able last summer to rear two
young hoopoes, taken from a nest which was placed at the top of an oak
tree. These little birds followed me everywhere, and when they heard
me at a distance showed their joy by a particular chirping, jumped into
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>the air, or as soon as I was seated climbed on my clothes, particularly
when giving them their food from a pan of milk, the cream of which
they swallowed greedily; they climbed higher and higher, till at last they
perched on my shoulders, and sometimes on my head, caressing me very
affectionately: notwithstanding this, I had only to speak a word to rid
myself of their company, they would then immediately retire to the stove.
Generally they would observe my eyes to discover what my temper might
be, that they might act accordingly. I fed them like the nightingales,
or with the universal paste, to which I sometimes added insects; they
would never touch earth-worms, but were very fond of beetles and May-bugs,
these they first killed, and then beat them with their beak into a
kind of oblong ball; when this was done, they threw it into the air, that
they might catch it and swallow it lengthways; if it fell across the throat
they were obliged to begin again. Instead of bathing, they roll in the
sand. I took them one day into a neighbouring field, that they might
catch insects for themselves, and had then an opportunity of remarking
their innate fear of birds of prey, and their instinct under it. As soon as
they perceived a raven, or even a pigeon, they were on their bellies in the
twinkling of an eye, their wings stretched out by the side of their head,
so that the large quill feathers touched: they were thus surrounded by a
sort of crown, formed by the feathers of the tail and wings, the head
leaning on the back, with the beak pointing upwards; in this curious
posture they might be taken for an old rag. As soon as the bird which
frightened them was gone they jumped up immediately, uttering cries of
joy. They were very fond of lying in the sun; they showed their
content by repeating in a quivering tone, &#8220;<i>vec, vec, vec</i>;&#8221; when angry
their notes are harsh, and the male, which is known by its colour being
redder, cries &#8220;<i>hoop, hoop</i>.&#8221; The female had the trick of dragging its
food about the room, by this means it was covered with small feathers and
other rubbish, which by degrees formed into an indigestible ball in its
stomach, about the size of a nut, of which it died. The male lived
through the winter; but not quitting the heated stove, its beak became
so dry that the two parts separated, and remained more than an inch apart;
thus it died miserably.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I once saw,&#8221; says Buffon, &#8220;one of these birds which had been taken
in a net, and being then old, or at least adult, must have had natural
habits: its attachment to the person who took care of it was very strong,
and even exclusive. It appeared to be happy only when alone with her;
if strangers came unexpectedly it raised its crest with surprise and fear,
and hid itself on the top of a bed which was in the room. Sometimes it
was bold enough to come from its asylum, but it fled directly to its
beloved mistress, and seemed to see no one but her. It had two very
different tones; one soft, as if from within, and seemed the very seat of
sentiment, which it addressed to its mistress; the other sharp, and more
piercing, which expressed anger and fear. It was never kept in a cage by
day or night, and was permitted to range the house at pleasure: however,
though the windows were often open, it never showed the least desire to
escape, its wish for liberty not being so strong as its attachment.</p>

<p>&#8220;This pretty bird accidentally died of hunger. Its mistress had kept
it for four months, feeding it only on bread and cheese.&#8221;</p></div>

changing like the throat of the pigeon on the back and wing-coverts.</p>

<p>In the female, which is smaller, the upper part of the body
is of a dark brown, with dirty brown spots, which are scarcely
visible. The under part of the neck is a mixture of ash grey
and yellow, crossed with dark streaks. The belly is of a dirty
white, with dark transverse lines.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Habitation.</span>&mdash;When wild, it is a bird of passage, which arrives in April
and departs in September, and even much sooner, according to an English
observer.</p>

<p>In the house, it may be let run about, or confined in a large wooden
cage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Food.</span>&mdash;When wild, it eats all sorts of insects, particularly caterpillars
on trees.</p>

<p>When confined, it is fed with meat, insects, and the universal paste
made of wheat-meal.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Breeding and Peculiarities.</span>&mdash;Every one knows that the female
cuckoo never sits upon her eggs, but intrusts that care to other birds,
particularly those which feed on insects, laying one or two eggs in their
nest.</p>

<p>In order to tame a cuckoo, it must be taken from the nest: I never tried
myself, but several of my friends have. As this is a curious bird, and
most bird-fanciers like to have it in their room or aviary, I shall here insert
some observations on this subject, by M. von Schauroth, who was before
quoted.</p>

<p>&#8220;The cuckoo possesses hardly any qualities which would render it fit
to be a house bird: if old, it is too obstinate and voracious, generally it is
furious, sullen, and melancholy. I have reared several; the last was
taken from the nest of a yellowhammer: its eyes were not opened when I
took it, yet it darted at me with fury. Before I had had it six days it would
swallow in a passion everything that came near it. I fed it on bird&#8217;s flesh,
and was obliged to continue this food for a long time before it could feed
itself. Its motions were so quick in jumping or moving that it would
overthrow any cups of food which happened to be in its way. Its tail
grew very slowly. It was never entirely tamed; it would dart at my
hands and face, attacked every thing which came too near it, and even the
other birds. It ate the poultry paste in great quantities, and discharged in
proportion, which made it very dirty; I have even seen it, like the ostrich,
eat its own excrements. Its short and climbing feet are so awkward that
it cannot walk; it makes two or three jumps, but flies very well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Though cunning and solitary,&#8221; says Buffon, &#8220;the cuckoos may be
given some sort of education. Several persons of my acquaintance have
reared and tamed them. They feed them on minced meat, either dressed
or raw, insects, eggs, soaked bread, and fruit. One of these tamed cuckoos
knew its master, came at his call, followed him to the chase, perched
on his gun, and if it found a cherry tree in its way it would fly to it, and
not return till it had eaten plentifully; sometimes it would not return to
its master for the whole day, but followed him at a distance, flying from
tree to tree. In the house it might range at will, and passed the night on
the roost. The excrement of this bird is white, and in great quantities;
this is one of the disagreeables in rearing it. Great care must be taken
to keep it from the cold from autumn till winter; this is the critical period
for these birds, at least it was at this time that I lost all which I had
tried to rear, besides many other birds of a different species.&#8221;</p></div>

<h4>THE MINOR GRAKLE.</h4>

Plauderer, <span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> bird is the size of a blackbird, ten inches and a half
long, of which the tail measures three, and the beak one
and a half. The feathers on the side of the head are short,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
like velvet, but on the top, descending towards the back of the
head, they are the general length; on both sides of the head
there is naked skin, which begins under the eyes, and extends
to the back of the head, but without uniting; its breadth is
uneven, near the eyes it is wide and yellow, but when the bird
is pleased or is angry this colour varies. Black is the predominant
colour of the body, with some tints of purple, violet,
or green, according to the different light it is in; the feathers
of the tail have a white streak.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Observations.</span>&mdash;The minor grakle is found in both the Indies, in
Jamaica, as well as in the islands beyond the Ganges, as far as Java.
Their food is vegetable: those which are brought to Europe willingly eat
cherries and raisins; if these be shown them without being given directly
they begin to cry and weep like a child. They become exceedingly tame
and confiding; they whistle exceedingly well, and chatter better than
any parrot. The Chinese ladies are very fond of them; they are sold
very dear in Java. In the inland parts of Germany nothing is so rare as
one of these birds.</p></div>

<p class="caption">THE MACCAW.</p></div>

<h3>LARGE BEAKED BIRDS.</h3>

<p>The general characteristics of this group are, a beak large,
but varying in size, very hollow, light, raised above, and
hooked before; in the species immediately following, the legs
are short, strong, and the feet formed for climbing; they are
furnished with a tongue, thick, fleshy, and rounded like the
human tongue, which renders articulation easy to them. All
these birds are foreign, and ought to be reared from the nest
when intended for speaking.</p>

<hr />

<h4>THE RED AND BLUE MACCAW.</h4>

<p class="center">Psittacus Macao, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; L&#8217;Lra Rouge, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Der rothe Aras, <span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> beauty of their plumage, and the facility with which
they repeat words, are the two principal reasons for the intro<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>duction
of parrots into parlours. Some imitate the songs of
other birds and warble very sweetly. We have observed, that
in order to speak distinctly the tongue must be thick, rounded,
and the muscle loose enough to permit the requisite motion;
hence it happens that parrots, above all those with a short
tail, pronounce so very distinctly. The ravens, jack-daws, and
jays come next to them; but the starlings and blackbirds
surpass them in the formation of the larynx.</p>

<p>The red and blue maccaw is one of the largest of the parrot
tribe, being two feet eight inches in length. The hardest
stones of the peach cannot resist the strength of its beak, the
upper mandible of which is very much hooked. The claws
are directed forward, and two backward. The naked cheeks
are covered with a wrinkled whitish skin. The head, neck,
breast, belly, thighs, top of the back, and the upper wing-coverts
are of the finest vermilion. The lower part of the
back and the rump are light blue. The scapulars and large
wing-coverts are a mixture of blue, yellow, and green.</p>

<p>The colours sometimes vary, especially in the wings and
tail, but the species will not be the less easily known on that
account.</p>

<p>The female very much resembles the male.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Habitation.</span>&mdash;When wild it inhabits South America, and may be found
in Brazil and Guiana, in damp woods, and always in pairs. In the house
it may be let range at will, giving it a roost with several rings placed across.
Like its fellows, it may be kept in a very large strong wire cage, high and
wide enough to let it move with ease, and preserve its handsome tail in all
its beauty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Food.</span>&mdash;In its native country the fruit of the palm tree is its principal
food; our fruit it also likes, but white bread soaked in milk agrees with it
better; biscuit does not hurt it; but meat, sweetmeats, and other niceties
are very injurious; and though at first it does not appear to be injured, it
becomes unhealthy, its feathers stand up separate, it pecks and tears them,
above all those on the first joint of the pinion, and it even makes holes in
different parts of its body. It drinks little&mdash;this is perhaps occasioned by
its eating nothing dry. Many bird-fanciers say that the best food for
parrots is simply the crumbs of white bread, well baked, without salt, soaked
in water, and then slightly squeezed in the hand. But though this appears
to agree with them pretty well, it is however certain that now and then
something else ought to be added. I have observed, indeed, that parrots
which are thus fed are very thin, have hardly strength to bear moulting, and
sometimes even do not moult at all; in that case they become asthmatic,
and die of consumption. It is clear that feeding them only on this food,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>which has very little if any moisture in it, is not sufficient to nourish them
properly, at least during the moulting season, and while the feathers are
growing again. I never saw a parrot in better health than one which
belonged to a lady, who fed it on white bread soaked in boiled milk, having
more milk than the bread would absorb, which the parrot drank with
apparent pleasure; there was also put into the drawer of its cage some sea
biscuit, or white bread soaked in boiling water; it was also given fruit
when in season. It is necessary to be very careful that the milk is not
sour.</p>

<p>Some young maccaws are fed on hemp-seed, which must always be of the
year before, as the new would be too warm and dangerous. Yet they must
not be fed entirely on this food, but there must be added white bread
soaked in milk or water, as has already been mentioned, some fruit and
nuts, but never bitter almonds, as they will infallibly kill all young animals.
In all cases the excrements of the bird will indicate the state of its health,
and whether the food ought to be changed or not.</p>

<p>Although maccaws rarely want to drink, as their food is very moist, yet
they must not be left without water, which is generally placed in one of
the divisions of their tin drawer. It is also a good thing to entice them to
bathe, nothing is more favourable to their health, or better facilitates the
painful operation of moulting, or keeps their feathers in better order. A
little attention to these favourites, deprived of their liberty, their natural
climate, and food, cannot be too much trouble to amiable persons who are
fond of them, and to whom these pretty birds become greatly attached.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Breeding.</span>&mdash;The red and blue maccaws build their nests in the holes of
old decayed trees; they enlarge and make the hole even with their beak,
and line it with feathers. The female, like that of the other American
parrots, breeds twice in the year, laying two eggs each time, which are
exactly like those of the partridge. In Europe the females also lay well,
but the eggs are generally unfruitful; when they are not so it is very difficult
to make the mother sit; there are, however, a few examples of the
female maccaw being so well inclined to perform this office, that she will
sit on pigeons&#8217; and hens&#8217; eggs, which are hatched in due time.</p>

<p>The maccaws which we have in this country have generally been reared
from the nest, particularly those which speak, for the old ones would be
too savage and untractable, and would only stun one with their unbearable
cries, the faithful interpreters of their different passions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diseases.</span>&mdash;Amongst those to which maccaws are particularly subject,
declines are the most frequent. Some cures for this are mentioned in the
Introduction, which it would be well to employ. During the moulting
season attention must be redoubled, not only to keep them in health but
to preserve their beautiful plumage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attractive Qualities.</span>&mdash;As maccaws are very dear they are generally
only found in the possession of rich bird-fanciers. In the centre of Germany
one costs from fifty to a hundred rix dollars, and in the maritime
cities thirty or forty. Their beautiful plumage forms their principal attraction.
They also learn to repeat many words, to go and come, and also to
obey the least signal from their master. I confess, however, that their
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>awkward walk, their heavy movements, and their constant inclination to
help themselves along with their beak, added to their great uncleanliness,
does not appear very agreeable. They are sometimes very wicked, taking
dislike to some people, and may do great injury to children if left alone
with them. Owing to their dung being very liquid, abundant, and f&oelig;tid,
they must be cleaned regularly every day.</p></div>

<h4>THE BLUE AND YELLOW MACCAW.</h4>

<p class="center">Psittacus Ararauna, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; L&#8217;Lra Bleu; Der Blaue Aras, <span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> species, which is about the size of the former, appears
to me much more beautiful, though the colours of its plumage
are not so striking. Its beak is black, the feet dark grey; the
cheeks flesh-coloured, streaked in the form of an S, with lines
of short black feathers. The iris is light yellow; the throat
ornamented with a black collar; the forehead, to the top of the
head, the sides, and small wing-coverts are of a dark green; the
rest of the upper part of the body is of a fine blue; all the
colours are apt to vary.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Habitation.</span>&mdash;Being, like the preceding one, a native of Surinam,
Guiana, and Brazil, its way of living and qualities are much the same. It
does not, however, learn to speak so easily, and cannot pronounce the
word <i>maccaw</i> so distinctly; but it imitates perfectly the bleating of sheep,
the mewing of cats, and the barking of dogs. Its custom of only drinking
in the evening seems extraordinary.</p></div>

<h4>THE ILLINOIS PARROT.</h4>

<p class="center">Psittacus pertinax, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; La Perruche Illinoise; Der Illinesische
Sittich, <span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> is a species which almost all bird-sellers have. Its
length is nine inches and a half. The beak is light grey, the
eyes surrounded with a naked greyish skin, the iris is deep
orange. The feet are dark grey. The principal colour on the
top of the body is green, that under is yellowish grey. The
forehead, cheeks, and throat are of a brilliant orange; the top
of the head is dark green; this colour is lighter and yellowish
on the back of the head; the top of the neck is greenish grey;
there are some orange spots on the belly.</p>

<p>In the female, the forehead only is deep yellow, and there is
no other mixture of yellow either on the head or belly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Habitation.</span>&mdash;This parrot is also a native of the hottest parts of South
America, frequenting savannas, or any other open places, and building its
nest even in the holes of the Termites (<i>Termes fatalis</i>, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>.) These
birds are so sociable that they may be seen in flocks of five or six
hundred.</p>

<p>In the house, they must always be kept in pairs, and generally in cages.
They show the tenderness of their attachment to each other by their continual
caresses; this is in fact so great, that if one die the other soon
languishes from grief.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Food.</span>&mdash;When these birds go forth to steal chestnuts, acorns, peas, and
similar fruits, which form their food, they always place a sentinel to warn
them of the approach of an enemy: at the least alarm, they fly away,
uttering loud cries. When confined, they are fed with nuts, and bread
soaked in boiled milk.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attractive Qualities.</span>&mdash;Their handsome plumage, their affectionate and
confiding ways, and the tenderness of attachment which these pretty birds
have for each other, make them great favourites; but they learn scarcely
any thing, and their continual cries are sometimes very annoying.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> length of this species is twelve inches and a half, but
the tail alone measures seven inches and a half. This bird is
not larger than a blackbird; the folded wings only cover one
quarter of the tail, the centre feathers of which are nearly five
inches longer than the exterior ones. The upper mandible of
the beak is of a blood red, with the point black; the under
one is entirely black. The circle of the eyes, the naked membrane
of the beak, and the feet, are flesh-coloured; the irides
are orange. The rest of the body is yellowish green, with the
wings bordered with light yellow. There are varieties of different
shades of green, the tail feathers of which are blue at
the extremity.</p>

<p>This species inhabits the hottest part of South America. Its
cry is noisy and frequent; it soon learns to speak, whistle, and
imitate the sounds of most animals as well as birds. In the
cage, where it cannot have much other exercise, it chatters and
squalls so incessantly, that it is often very disagreeable. It
must be treated like the preceding species, but does not appear

green, the under part yellowish. The forehead has some tints
of red; the head is blue; the throat violet, with a grey tint.</p>

parrot green, the long lower coverts of the tail crimson, edged
with greenish yellow; the knee bands have a shade of sky
blue. The under part of the body is of a brilliant yellow, with
some irregular red dashes and spots, which show its relation to

<h4>VARIETIES OF THE CARDINAL PARROT.</h4>

<p class="indent">1. The Blossom-headed Parrakeet, <span class="smcap">Latham</span>; Psittacus erythrocephalus, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>;
Perruche &agrave; t&ecirc;te rouge de Gingi, Buffon; Der Rothk&ouml;pfige Sittich aus Gingi,
<span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> head is red, having on the back a mixture of light
blue. A narrow black line passes from the chin to the nape
of the neck; another line, of light green, below the former,
forms with it a ring round the neck. The rest of the plumage
is green, but the under part of the body has a tint of light
yellow. The tail is green above, having the inner border light
yellow.</p>

<p class="indent">2. The Rose-headed Ring Parrakeet, <span class="smcap">Latham</span>; Psittacus erythrocephalus Bengalensis,
<span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; Petite Perruche &agrave; t&ecirc;te couleur de rose longs brins, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>;
Der Rothk&ouml;pfige Sittich aus Bengalen, <span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> upper mandible is light yellow, the lower black, the
membrane brownish. The top of the head and cheeks are rose
coloured, the back of the head blue, the throat and ring like
the preceding variety, as well as the red spot on the wing-coverts;
the two centre feathers of the tail are blue, the others
green, edged with blue.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">3. The Borneo Parrakeet; Psittacus erythrocephalus Borneus, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>;
Perruche &agrave; t&ecirc;te rouge de p&ecirc;cher de Borneo; Der Rothk&ouml;pfige Sittich aus
Borneo, <span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> upper mandible is red, the under black, the membrane
ash-coloured, the iris the same; the whole head is peach-blossom,
with a green tint on the forehead; there is a black
line between the eyes, near the membrane of the beak; another
extends from the lower mandible obliquely on each side of the
neck, widening on the back. The upper part of the body to
the tail is light green, shading to light yellow towards the
middle of the wing-coverts; all the under part from the chin
is peach blossom, tinged with chestnut colour; the feathers of
the thighs, the tail-coverts, and the middle of the belly, are
green; the feathers of the tail are the same, but the centre
ones are rather brown, and all are spotted with white.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Observations.</span>&mdash;This parrakeet, so easily distinguished by its plumage,
is lively, fearful, and its cry is frequent. It learns nothing of itself, and
it is with great difficulty that it can be made to repeat a few words. I
have seen it, with the preceding and following species, among the beautiful
collection of birds belonging to his Highness the Duke of Meiningen.</p></div>

<h4>THE RED-HEADED GUINEA PARRAKEET.</h4>

<p class="center">Psittacus Manillensis, <span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>; Perruche &agrave; collier couleur de rose, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>;
Der Manilische Sittich, <span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> beautiful species, whose colours are soft and the feathers
thick and silky, is hardly larger than the thrush, though its
length is from fourteen to fifteen inches, two-thirds of which
are included in the tail. The naked membrane is flesh-coloured,
the eyelids very red. The plumage is, in general, light green.
From the black throat there extends a ring round the neck,
which is black at first, and afterwards pale rose colour; the
back of the neck in old birds has a blue tint.</p>

<p>In the female the black of the throat is not so wide, there is
no rose-coloured ring, and the under part of the body more
nearly approaches yellow.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Observations.</span>&mdash;This species, which is very mild, tame, and beautiful, is
a native of the Philippines, particularly Manilla; some say that it is also
very common in Africa. It is very pleasing, certainly, but rarely learns to
speak, and then only a few words. It must be treated like other delicate
species.</p></div>

<hr />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span></p>



<h4>THE PAVOUAN PARROT.</h4>

<p class="center">Psittacus Guianensis, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; La Perruche Pavouane, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Der Guianische
Sittich, <span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> species is only twelve inches in length, including the
tail, which measures six and a quarter, and has the two centre
feathers three inches longer than the others. The upper part
of the body is dark green, the under lighter. The cheeks
are not spotted with bright red till the third year.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Observations.</span>&mdash;It is a native of Guiana, Cayenne, and the Caribbee
Islands. Bird-sellers in Germany are generally provided with them, as
they are not delicate or difficult to carry about. They must be treated
like the former species.</p>

<p>&#8220;This,&#8221; says Buffon, &#8220;is, of all parrots from the new continent, the
most easily taught to speak; nevertheless it is only tractable in this particular,
for even after a long captivity it still preserves a native wildness
and ferocity, and is sometimes stubborn and ill-humoured. But as it has
a lively eye, is neatly and well formed, it is admired for its shape.&#8221;</p></div>

<hr />

<h4>THE ROSE-RINGED PARRAKEET.</h4>

<p class="center">Psittacus pullarius, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; La Perruche &agrave; t&ecirc;te rouge, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Der Rothk&ouml;pfige
Guineische Sittich, <span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bird-sellers</span> give the name of <i>Guinea-sparrow</i> to this
little parrakeet, which is not larger than the common crossbill.
The beak is red, but pale at the tip, the membrane at
the base ash colour, as well as the circle round the eyes. The
feet are grey, the iris bluish; the front part of the head and
throat are red; the edge of the wings and rump blue. The
upper side of the tail feathers is red, the under has a black
streak, the tip is green; the two centre feathers are entirely
green, like the rest of the body.</p>

<p>In the female, the colours are the same, though lighter, and
the lower part of the wing is yellow.</p>

<p>These birds may be found in any part of the torrid zone in
the old world, from Guinea to India. As most of them died
on the voyage, there were formerly very few of them in
Europe, but as the means of preserving them is now better
known, most bird-sellers have them. Though they cannot<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
learn to speak, and their cry is rather disagreeable, yet one
cannot help admiring them as much for their beauty as their
great mildness. They are so much attached to each other that
they must always be had in pairs, and if one dies the other
rarely survives it. Some people think that a mirror hung in
the cage, in which the survivor may imagine that it still sees
its lost companion, will console it. The male remains affectionately
near the female, feeds her, and gives her the most
tender caresses; she, in her turn, shows the greatest uneasiness
if she be separated from him for an instant. In the
countries which this species inhabits, it makes great havoc
among the corn. In Europe it is fed on canary seed, millet,
and white bread soaked in boiled milk.</p>

<h4>THE CAROLINA PARROT.</h4>

<p class="center">Psittacus Carolinensis, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span><a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">26</a>; La Perruche &agrave; t&ecirc;te jaune, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>, pl. enl. 499;
Der Carolinische Sittich, <span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> bird is about the size of a turtle-dove; its length is
thirteen inches, of which the tail measures at least half. The
beak is as white as ivory, the membrane and naked circle of
the eyes, as well as the feet and claws, greyish white; the
front of the head of a beautiful orange, the back, the nape of
the neck, and the throat, light yellow; the rest of the neck,
the back, breast, belly, and sides, are green; the tail is green,
and very wedge-shaped.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Observations.</span>&mdash;A native of Guiana; this pretty parrot also breeds in
Carolina, and sometimes even penetrates into Virginia in large flocks
during the fruit season, making great ravages among the nuts, of which it
only eats almonds, rejecting all others. It is frequently brought to Europe;
and in Paris it is the species of parrot which costs the most. It is fed,
says Buffon, on hemp seed; but it is better to add white bread soaked in
water, or boiled milk which is not sour, wheat, Indian corn, and the like.
Its cry is frequent; it is rather wicked, and does not speak; but it well
makes up for this by its beauty, the elegance of its form, its graceful
movements, and its strong and almost exclusive attachment to its mistress;
it likes to hang by the beak, even while sleeping, and will let itself be
carried thus every where without moving for a very long time.</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span></p>

<h4>THE LITTLE BLUE AND GREEN PARRAKEET.</h4>

<p class="center">Psittacus passerinus, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; La Perruche passerine &eacute;t&eacute;, ou Toui &eacute;t&eacute;, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>;
Der Sperlingsparkit, <span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Its</span> size very little exceeds that of the sparrow. A beautiful
light green is the predominant colour of its plumage; but
the rump is blue, the large wing-coverts are the same; the
small ones, again, are green. The beak, the membrane at the
base, the circle of the eyes, and the feet, are often orange; it
sometimes varies, however, to yellow, ash colour, and flesh
colour.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Observations.</span>&mdash;This species is as social and affectionate as the preceding,
but much more rare and dear. It is a native of Brazil, and cannot
speak. It must be fed on canary seed, millet, and hemp.</p></div>

<hr />

<h4>THE GREY-BREASTED PARROT.</h4>

<p class="center">Psittacus murinus, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; La Perruche &agrave; poitrine grise, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Der
gr&uuml;nbrustige Sittich, <span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> pretty parrot, distinguished by its silvery grey colour,
is about the size of a turtle-dove. Its ruffling the feathers of
its head, particularly on the cheeks, added to the smallness
and peculiar way in which it holds its bill, which is always
buried in its breast, gives it somewhat the appearance of a
small screech owl. Its length is ten inches, of which the
wedge-shaped tail measures half. The beak is three-quarters
of an inch in length, pearl grey, or whitish. The forehead, to
about the middle of the top of the head, the cheeks, throat,
breast, and half the belly are of a light silvery grey, with
shades appearing like grey stripes; the upper part of the body
and tail are of a brilliant siskin green.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Observations.</span>&mdash;This species is very mild, speaks but little, and even
seems to be of a melancholy turn. Its call, which is &#8220;<i>keirshe</i>,&#8221; is loud
and sonorous. It is the same species which is mentioned in the Travels
of Bougainville, by Pernetty. &#8220;We found it,&#8221; says he, &#8220;at Montevideo,
where our sailors bought several at two piastres a-piece. These birds
were very tame and harmless; they soon learnt to speak, and became so
fond of the men that they were never easy when away from them.&#8221; The
general opinion is, that they will not live more than a year and a half if
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>kept in a cage; this prejudice is completely refuted by the bird from which
this description is taken, and which may be seen in the collection of his
Highness the Duke of Saxe Meiningen.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> species, which is rather common among us, is ten
inches in length, of which the tail measures half, of which the
folded wings cover one third; the forehead is scarlet, the top of
the head a fine sky blue, paler at the back; the upper part of
the body meadow green, the under lighter.</p>

<p>The forehead is orange, and the circle of the eye pale yellow
may be peculiar to the female.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Observations.</span>&mdash;This parrot is handsome, but does not speak. Although
a native of South America, is not very delicate or difficult to preserve. The
food as usual.</p></div>

<p class="center">Psittacus lunatus, <span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>; Der Mondfleckige, <span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> species, which I have not found described by any
author, may be seen in the collection belonging to his Highness
the Duke of Saxe Meiningen. Its length is eleven inches
and a half, of which the tail measures six. The beak, one inch
in length. The forehead is deep red, a crescent of the same
colour extends towards the upper part of the neck, ornamenting
the top of the breast; the upper part of the body is leek green,
becoming a little darker on the head. The under part of the
body is light green, slightly tinted with red on the breast; the
under part of the pen and tail feathers is dirty yellow.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Observations.</span>&mdash;I do not know of what country this parrot is a native.
It appears very lively, cries often and very loudly &#8220;<i>goeur, goeur</i>,&#8221; speaks
prettily and distinctly, and appears very healthy. The bird from which
the description is taken is certainly a proof that this species will attain a
great age, for it is very old.</p></div>

<h4>THE GREAT WHITE COCKATOO.</h4>

Kakatu, <span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> size of this bird is that of a barn-door fowl, and its
length seventeen inches. The beak is blackish, and the membrane
at the base black; the iris is dark brown, the circle of
the eye white. The whole of the plumage is white except the
large quill-feathers and the exterior feathers of the tail, the
inner beards of which are primrose-yellow to the centre. The
tuft, which the bird raises and sinks at will, is five inches in
length.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Observations.</span>&mdash;At present, this species is only found in the Moluccas.
The general custom in Germany is to give it a spacious cage in the form
of a bell, from the top of which is hung a large metal ring, in which it
likes to perch.</p>

<p>The food of the cockatoo is the same as that of the other large species
of the same family; however, it appears to be very fond of vegetables,
farinaceous grains, and pastry. For its qualities, I cannot do better than
quote Buffon:</p>

<p>&#8220;Cockatoos,&#8221; says he, &#8220;which may be known by their tuft, are not
easily taught to speak; there is one species which does not speak at all;
but this is in some measure compensated for by the great facility with
which they are tamed; in some parts of India they are even so far domesticated
that they will build their nests on the roofs of the houses: this
facility of education is owing to their intelligence, which is very superior to
that of other parrots. They listen, understand, and obey; but it is in
vain that they make the same efforts to repeat what is said to them: they
seem to wish to make up for it by other expressions of feeling and by affectionate
caresses. There is a mildness and grace in all their movements,
which greatly adds to their beauty. In March, 1775, there were two, a
male and female, at the fair of St. Germain, in Paris, which obeyed with
great docility the orders given them, either to spread out their tuft, or salute
people with a bend of the head, or to touch different objects with
their beak and tongue, or to reply to questions from their master with a
mark of assent which clearly expressed a silent <i>yes</i>: they also showed by
repeated signs the number of persons in the room, the hour of day, the
colour of clothes, &amp;c.; they kissed one another by touching their beaks,
and even caressed each other; this showed a wish to pair, and the master
affirms that they often do so even in our climates. Though the cockatoos,
like other parrots, use their bill in ascending and descending, yet they have
not their heavy disagreeable step; on the contrary, they are very active,
and hop about very nimbly.&#8221;</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> length of this species is fourteen inches and a half.
The beak, the naked membrane, and feet are blackish; the
circle of the eye is rather white, and the iris inclining to red.
The general colour of this species is also white, with a primrose-yellow
tint on the wings and tail, as well as a spot of the
same colour under the eyes. The tuft, which is pointed, and
composed of soft thread-like feathers, is of lemon-colour.</p>

<p>It comes from the same country as the preceding, to which
it yields neither in elegance, intelligence, docility, nor mildness.
It is fond of caresses, and returns them with pleasure:
all its motions are equally full of grace, delicacy, and beauty.
There are two varieties of this species, which only differ in
size.</p>

<h4>THE GREAT RED-CRESTED COCKATOO.</h4>

<p class="center">Psittacus Moluccensis, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; Kakatoes &agrave; huppe rouge, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Der
roth&auml;ubige Kakatu, <span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> species is a little larger than the common cockatoo, its
size being almost equal to that of the red and blue maccaw.
Its beak is bluish black, the membrane black, the circle of the
eyes pearl grey, and the iris deep red. The feet are lead
colour, the nails black. White, tinged with pale rose-red, is
the prevailing colour; the tuft, which falls back on the head,
is very large, most of the feathers being six inches in length;
of which the under side is of a beautiful orange. In the side
tail feathers, from the base to the centre of the interior beard,
the colour is primrose-yellow; the under part of the pen-feathers
has a tint of the same.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Observations.</span>&mdash;This beautiful bird has a noble air; and, though often
tamed, it is rarely so caressing as the common cockatoo; its cry, like that
of the other species, is its own name; it also cries &#8220;<i>tertingue</i>&#8221; very
loud, and like a trumpet, and imitates the voice of several animals, particularly
the cackling of fowls and the crowing of cocks. When it cries it
flaps its wings.</p>

<p>Though a native of the Moluccas, it is neither delicate nor difficult to
rear.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> species, the size of the grey parrot, is but thirteen
inches in length. The beak is white, or of a pale flesh colour,
and grey at the base; the circle of the eyes is yellowish-red;
the feet are of a silver-grey; the general colour of the body is
white; the head is ornamented with a tuft, in which there is
nothing remarkable but its raising it in the form of a shell.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Observations.</span>&mdash;It is a native of the Philippines. Its beauty and great
docility are its chief merits; for it cannot speak, and it also appears of a
jealous nature, being angry when it sees the other parrots caressed, and
making the unpleasant cry of &#8220;<i>aiai, miai!</i>&#8221; but never &#8220;<i>cockatoo</i>.&#8221;</p></div>

<span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> certainly is the handsomest, rarest, and most precious
of all the cockatoos. It is as large as the red and blue maccaw,
its length being from twenty-two to thirty inches. The beak
is thick, yellowish, and black at the point; the iris red, and
the feet black. Black is the prevailing colour of its plumage;
the tuft is rather long, but in a state of tranquillity lies flat on
the head, as in the preceding cockatoo; each feather has a
yellowish spot exactly on the tip; the wing-coverts are also
terminated with a similar spot.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Varieties.</span>&mdash;Of this beautiful species there are several
varieties.</p>

<p>1. Those with the beak lead-coloured; the tuft of a moderate
size, black mixed with the yellow feathers; the throat
yellow; the sides of the neck spotted with yellow and black;
the tail as above; all the rest black, without any streaks on
the under part of the body.</p>

<p>2. Those with the beak bluish grey, plumage olive, or black,
with a yellowish tint on the sides of the head, but having no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
feather with a yellow tip. The belly of one colour, without
streaks; tail as above. This may possibly be a young one.</p>

<p>3. Those with the beak raven-grey; the head, the neck,
and the under part of the body of a dark dirty brown colour.
The feathers on the top of the head and nape of the neck are
bordered with olive: the upper part of the body, the wings
and tail, of a brilliant black; the centre feathers of the latter
are of one colour; the others scarlet in the middle, but without
streaks. This is perhaps a female.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Observations.</span>&mdash;This noble and handsome bird is still rather rare in
England, and still more so in Germany. It may be found in many parts
of New Holland; its motions resemble those of the common cockatoo
and the manner of treating it is the same.</p></div>

<h4>THE ASH-COLOURED PARROT.</h4>

<p class="center">Psittacus erithacus, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; Le Perroquet cendr&eacute;, ou le Jaco, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Der
Gemeiner aschgrauer Papagay, <span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> parrot and the following are the most common and
docile that we possess. Its length is nine inches. The beak
is black, the membrane at its base, and the circle of the eyes
have a powdered appearance. The feet are ash-coloured, the
iris yellowish. A fine pearl grey and slate-colour tinges the
whole body; the feathers of the head, neck, and belly are
edged with whitish grey; the tail, which is short, and of a
vermilion colour, terminates and relieves this shining and
watered plumage, which also has a powdered appearance. The
male and female are alike, and learn with equal facility. Most
of the birds of this species are brought from Guinea, but they
also inhabit the interior parts of Africa, as well as Congo and
the coasts of Angola.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Food.</span>&mdash;In its native country it lives on all kinds of fruit and grain; it
will also become quite fat on the seed of the safflower, which to man is so
violent a purgative. Here it eats any of our food; but white bread soaked
in boiled milk, and fruits, are what it likes best. Meat, of which it is very
fond, brings on diarrh&oelig;a, as in other parrots, and that kind of green sickness
which makes it peck itself and tear out its feathers, &amp;c.</p>

<p>There are some instances, when treated with care, of their having lived
for sixty years.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Breeding.</span>&mdash;In its native country this species builds in high trees. This
is the first of this group of birds which has bred in Europe. &#8220;M. de la
Pigeonni&egrave;re,&#8221; says Buffon, &#8220;had a male and female parrot in the city of
Marmanote, in Angenois, which used to breed regularly every spring for five
or six years; the young ones of each brood were always reared by the parent
birds. The female laid four eggs each time, three of which were fruitful,
and the other not so. In order that they may breed at their ease, they
must be placed in a room in which there is nothing but a barrel, open at
one end, and partly filled with saw-dust; sticks must be placed inside and
out of the barrel, that the male may ascend them whenever he likes, and
remain near his companion. Before entering this room the precaution
must be taken to put on boots, that the legs may be guarded from the
attacks of the jealous parrot, which pecks at everything which approaches
its female.&#8221; The P. Labat also gives an account of two parrots which had
&#8220;several broods in Paris.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diseases.</span>&mdash;This parrot becomes more subject to the different diseases in
proportion as it is fed on choice food. Gout in the feet is the most general,
and the specifics used for the bird are not more certain in their cure than
those used for man. It is not difficult to prevent this evil by great cleanliness,
and giving it no meat or other niceties.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attractive Qualities.</span>&mdash;This parrot, like the following, learns not only
to speak and whistle, but also to make all kinds of gestures; and it even
performs some tricks which require skill. It is particularly distinguished
by its pleasing and caressing behaviour to its master. As an example of
the talents of this species, Buffon gives an account of one which, &#8220;being
instructed on its voyage by an old sailor, had acquired his harsh, hoarse
voice so perfectly that it was often mistaken for him. Though it was
afterwards given to a young person, and no longer heard the voice, it never
forgot the lessons of its old master; and it was exceedingly amusing to
hear it pass from a soft pleasing voice to its old hoarse sea tone. This bird
not only has a great facility in imitating the voice of man, but it also seems
to have a wish to do so, and this wish is shown in its great attention, the
efforts which it makes to repeat the sounds it hears, and its constant repetition
of them, for it incessantly repeats any words which it has just learnt,
and endeavours to make its voice heard above every other. One is often
surprised to hear it say words and make sounds, which no one had taught
it, and to which it was not even suspected to have listened. It seemed to
practise its lesson every day till night, beginning again on the next morning.
It is while young that it shows this great facility in learning; its
memory is then better, and the bird is altogether more intelligent and
docile. This memory is sometimes very astonishing, as in a parrot which,
as Rodiginus tells, a cardinal bought for one hundred crowns of gold, because
it could repeat correctly the Apostles&#8217; Creed; and M. de la Borde tells us of
another which served as chaplain to the vessel, reciting the prayer to the
sailors, and afterwards repeating the rosary.&#8221;</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is of the size of a pigeon, its length being from ten to
eleven inches. The colours vary very much; but the following
are the most common. Beak orange-coloured, naked membrane
at its base, and the circle of the eyes grey; the iris deep yellow,
and feet brown. The predominating colour of the body is
bright red; but the small wing-coverts are a mixture of green
and yellow.</p>

<p>It comes from the Moluccas, and is treated like the preceding,
which it equals in docility.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> magnificent species is of the size of a pigeon, and ten
inches and a half in length. The beak is orange, the membrane
blackish, as well as the circle of the eyes. The top of the head
is purple black, or rather black shading to purple, on the nape
of the neck; a crescent of light yellow, more or less visible,
ornaments the under part of the throat. The outer edge of the
quill-feathers, and the small wing-coverts, are of a deep blue,
shading to sky blue; the others of a meadow green. The tail
is slightly wedge-shaped, and of a bluish purple, tinged with
red brown.</p>

<p>In the female, which is smaller, the crescent is either not
visible or only faintly marked; the blue on the head is very
slight; the border of the wing is a mixture of blue and green;
this is all the blue which there is in the wings.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Variety.</span>&mdash;The lower part of the back and belly, the rump, and the
thighs are white and rose colour; the upper and under tail-coverts red and
white; the wing-coverts green, with a mixture of light yellow; the beak
light yellow; the rest as usual.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Observations.</span>&mdash;This species has the same attractions as the other lories,
and to judge from the specimen which I have seen among the collection of
the Duke of Meiningen, it appeared to be the mildest, most endearing, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>amiable; in short, the most docile and talkative of all the parrots. It cries
<i>lory</i>, and chatters incessantly, but in a hollow voice, something like that
of a man who speaks from his chest; it repeats everything whistled to it in
a clear tone; it likes to be always caressed and paid attention to; its
memory is very good.</p>

<p>This delicate species, being preserved with difficulty during the voyage,
is also very rare and dear; it is a native of the Moluccas and of New
Guinea; it requires to be taken great care of, to be kept warm; and to have
its food changed when necessary.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> is about the size of the preceding. Its beak is orange;
the membrane and circle of the eyes of a dark flesh colour; the

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> is one of the most talkative parrots usually kept. Its
beak is whitish, the circle of the eyes white; the iris nut

The general colour is green, but the edge of the feathers is
brown, particularly in the front part of the body. The red
edge of the wing is the distinguishing characteristic of the male
in Buffon&#8217;s family of amazons.</p>

<p>This parrot is found in St. Domingo, Cuba, and even in

<p><span class="smcap">Tucans</span> are distinguished by the great size of their beak,
which is convex above, hooked towards the point, hollow, light,
and toothed on the edges like a saw. The feet have two claws
before and two behind. In summer these birds are brought
from South America to England and Holland, whence they are
taken to Germany, though not often. They eat fruit, berries,
grapes, bread, meat, and in general any of our food. In order
to swallow anything they throw it into the air, catching it in
their throats. They are generally reared from the nest,
which is placed in the hole of a tree, and only contains two
young ones, which in a short time are domesticated, and become
very attractive.</p>

<p>Of the nine inches, which is the whole length of this tucan,
the beak alone measures five, and is grey at the base and black
at the point. The upper part of the body is of a green black;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
the cheeks, throat, and front of the neck are orange, with a
crimson band across the breast. The stomach is of a fine red,

<h4>THE GREEN WOODPECKER.</h4>

<p class="center">Picus viridis, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; Le Pic vert, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Der Gr&uuml;nspecht, <span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> length of this bird is twelve inches and a half, but four
and a half of these are included in the tail, almost half of which
is covered by the folded wings. The beak, an inch and a half
in length, is triangular, very pointed, and of a dark grey; the
iris is grey; the tongue is five inches long, and furnished, like
that of the other woodpeckers, with a horny tip, and strong
hairs on each side, so as to be useful in catching and piercing
insects. The top of the head to the nape of the neck is of a
brilliant crimson; a black streak, which in old birds is often
tinged with red, descends on each side of the neck; the upper
part of the body is of a beautiful olive green, the under part of
a dusky greenish white: some transverse lines may be seen on
the belly, which become more distinct on the sides.</p>

<p>In the female the colours are paler, and there is less red on
the head, which, when it is young, is only grey.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Habitation.</span>&mdash;When wild, the green woodpecker, during summer,
frequents woods and orchards which are near these, but when the air be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>comes
cold, and the snow begins to fall, it approaches villages, and flies
from one garden to another; it passes the night in the holes of trees;
when it finds dead, decayed, or worm-eaten ones, it pierces them on all
sides with its strong beak, in order to find the insects they conceal. It
never attacks a healthy tree, therefore it is not right to kill it as being
mischievous; it only taps the bark of trees to make the insects come out,
and its strokes are then so quick that they resemble a humming.</p>

<p>In the house its fierce and impetuous character makes it necessary to
keep it in close confinement.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Food.</span>&mdash;In its wild state it constantly seeks the insects which live under
the bark and in the wood of trees; it also eats ants, and in winter will even
take bees from the hive.</p>

<p>In the house it is fed on nuts, ants&#8217; eggs, and meat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Breeding.</span>&mdash;The female lays three or four perfectly white eggs in the
hole of a tree; if the young are to be tamed they must be taken from the
nest when only half fledged; it is impossible to tame adults or old ones;
we cannot even make them eat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attractive Qualities.</span>&mdash;The beauty of its plumage is all that can be
said of it; for it is so fierce, quick, and stubborn, that it can only be kept
by means of a chain. I know no instance in which every kind of attention
has rendered it more docile and agreeable: it is always untractable.
One or two of these chained birds, however, do not look bad as a variety.
It is curious to see them crack the nuts.</p></div>

top of the head and the back black; the nape of the neck
crimson; the shoulders white, the wings and tail black, and
streaked with yellowish white; the belly of a dirty reddish
white, the part about the vent crimson.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Habitation and Food.</span>&mdash;This woodpecker continually ranges woods and
orchards in search of its food, which consists of insects, beech-mast, acorns,
nuts, and the seed of pines and firs. In order to crack the nuts, it fixes
them in the clefts of the trees. The female builds its nest in the hole of a
tree, and lays from four to six white eggs. Before moulting the head of
the young ones is red. They must be taken early from the nest if they are

<span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Though</span> it is six inches and a half in length, it is not larger
than our lark, because its tail includes three inches and a
quarter, and its beak nine lines. The iris is of a brownish
yellow, the feet, two claws of which are before and two behind,
are short, strong, and lead colour. The head is ash-coloured,
speckled with small rust-coloured spots mixed with some white
ones. The top of the head and half of the back are divided
lengthwise by a broad black streak, edged with rust colour;
the rest of the upper part of the body is of a fine grey, streaked
and speckled with black, white, and rust colour. In the female
the belly is paler than in the male.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Habitation.</span>&mdash;When wild, it is a bird of passage, which departs during
the first fortnight of September, and does not return till the end of April,
frequenting groves and orchards. In August it goes into gardens and fields
planted with cabbages and other vegetables.</p>

<p>In the house it is better to let it run about at will than to keep it in a
cage, where it would soil its feathers, particularly those on the belly and
breast, while playing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Food.</span>&mdash;In its wild state, the wryneck lives on insects, for catching which
it has a very long cylindrical tongue, with a hard point, that can be insinuated
into all the chinks and fissures of trees. Ants&#8217; eggs are a very
favourite food, and it does not dislike the ants themselves. Towards
autumn, when the latter fail, it is contented with elderberries till the time
of its departure which never varies.</p>

<p>In the house it must be first given ants&#8217; eggs; and then by degrees the
universal paste, to which it soon becomes accustomed; but, as it is delicate,
in order to preserve it for some time, the nightingales&#8217; food agrees
better with it. It is very amusing to see it search all the cracks and
crevices of the room for insects; and if a few ants&#8217; eggs were now and then
put there, it would give it the greatest pleasure.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Breeding.</span>&mdash;Its nest, which it places in the hole of a tree, is formed of
moss, wool, hair, and straw. It lays eight eggs, which are white, and very
smooth. The adults and old ones are difficult to preserve and tame; but
the young ones may be easily reared on ants&#8217; eggs, and the universal paste,
made of the crumb of white bread.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mode of Taking.</span>&mdash;In general it is caught by putting lime twigs round
the nest; but if the weather be stormy, as in spring, when it is busy
searching the bushes for insects, it may even be taken by the hand. The
one I now have was brought to me by a little boy who had taken it in this
manner.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attractive Qualities.</span>&mdash;Independently of its beautiful plumage, it is
very amusing to see it make those movements which have given it its name
of wryneck. It lengthens its neck, and turns round its head, so that the
beak points down the back. Its general position is quite straight; the
feathers of the head and throat very smooth, and the tail spread like a fan,
at the same time bowing low. If it be irritated, or even if its food be
brought, it slowly leans forward, raising the feathers on its head, lengthening
and turning its neck, rolling its eyes; it then bows, spreads its tail, and
murmurs some harsh sounds in its throat; in short, it puts itself in the
most singular attitudes, and makes the most ridiculous grimaces. At other
times it seems to have a melancholy disposition. In spring the male often
cries in a full tone, <i>gui, gui, gui, gui</i>, to call its female.</p>

<p>M. de Schauroth informs me that two wrynecks which he reared became
so tame, that they would hang about his clothes, and begin to warble as
soon as they heard him, or saw him even at a distance. One day, being
wearied and teazed with its incessant cries, he drove one out of the window;
but having called it towards evening, it immediately replied to his voice, and
permitted itself to be taken. One of these birds, which he let range about
at will, having perched on a neighbouring tree, he had only to hold out and
show it the box containing its food, and it returned immediately.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> Bird, which is about the size of a magpie, has been placed
among the cuckoos by Linn&aelig;us, and those who have copied him,
only because its cry is <i>couc, couc</i>; for in no other respect does
it belong to this genus. Its beak is short and thick, and resembles
that of the pigeon in shape; the upper is bent over
the lower, and of a reddish brown; the nostrils are covered
with feathers; the iris is nut-brown; the eyelids are edged
with small red warts; the opening of the throat is wide,
extending to the back of the ears; the nails of an ash grey; the
head, throat, neck, top of the back, with the upper wing-coverts,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
the breast, upper part of the belly and sides, are covered
with soft silky feathers, of a beautiful deep green; the feathers
on the top of the head gradually lengthen into a large triangular
tuft, which the bird raises at will, and the tip of which
is red. The green in the tuft is sometimes mixed with
white.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Observations.</span>&mdash;The Tourako, which I have seen, belonging to his
Highness the Duke of Saxe Meiningen, is one of the most elegant, mildest,
and tamest of all foreign birds which I know. Its cry is <i>couc, couc, couc</i>,
at first repeated slowly and distinctly, afterwards more quickly, and then
in a rapid and continued succession. Notwithstanding the form of its feet it
does not climb or hop, but runs as quickly as any partridge across the room,
and often, pressing its wings against its body, makes several long leaps of
ten feet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Food.</span>&mdash;The tongue is not perceptible on opening its beak, and it swallows
every thing whole which is given it. It is fed on fruit and bread cut in
small pieces; it has been remarked that it has a crop.</p>

<p>Buffon says, that one of these birds, which came from the Cape, ate rice;
but that which I have seen would not touch it; on the contrary, it ate
with avidity the stones of grapes, as well as bits of apple and orange; so
that it may be concluded that fruit is its natural food. It is brought from
Guinea, but may be found in other parts of Africa.</p></div>

<h4>THE COMMON KINGFISHER.</h4>

<p class="center">Alcedo Ispida, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; L&#8217;Llcyon, ou Martin P&ecirc;cheur, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Der Eisvogel,
<span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> length of this bird is seven inches, of which the short
tail only measures one and a quarter, the legs are very short,
being only four lines in height, and the outer claw is united to
the centre one, as far as the first joint. The beak, an inch and
a half in length, is strong, straight and pointed. The iris is
dark brown; the top of the head and the wing-coverts are of a
deep green; the one with transverse and the other with oval
spots of a beautiful sky blue. The back and shoulders shine
with the most beautiful blue. In the female the colours are
darker, and the sky blue there is in them only meadow green.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Habitation.</span>&mdash;When wild this is a solitary bird, which remains the
whole year on the edges of ponds, streams, and rivers. During the winter
it may be seen watching for its prey at the holes in the ice, placed on a stone
or stick, or perched on the branch of a tree.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span></p>

<p>In the house it does not walk or hop, but flies or remains perched. It
is very necessary to put some turf or branches in a corner, or it must be
kept in a cage with a perch; it constantly remains in the same place.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Food.</span>&mdash;In its wild state its food is small fish, leeches, and, indeed, all
aquatic worms and insects. In the house it must be given as much as
possible the same, accustoming it by degrees to eat meat. It is very
rarely that those taken when old can be preserved. I have seen one,
however, which ate even dead fish. The meat and small fish for its food
must be put into a bowl of fresh water, large enough, or so firmly fixed,
that it may not be easily overturned. When taking its food it does not
hop to the bottom of the cage, but stretches itself downwards till it can
reach the water with its beak, at least if it be not a young one reared in the
house.&mdash;It will not eat while being looked at.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Paxton&#8217;s method of management.</span>&mdash;&#8220;Having become possessed,&#8221;
says Mr. Paxton, &#8220;of some young kingfishers last summer, we were very
anxious to rear them; this we have accomplished, and, to the best of our
information, it is the first time kingfishers were ever reared by hand. To
accomplish this object we had a wire cage constructed about ten feet long,
and four broad; the back part of the cage was made to imitate, as nearly
as possible, the banks of a river;&mdash;through this cage a small stream of
water was conducted, in which the birds received their food, &amp;c. When
the young birds were first taken from the nest, minnows and bullheads were
their principal food; they have since been fed on almost every species of
fresh-water fish, although they evince a marked preference for trout.</p>

<p>&#8220;Immediately on a quantity of small fish being put into the stream of
water, they commence killing them, regardless of who may be near; and
so surely do they strike, that, although we have repeatedly observed them,
we never yet saw them miss their prey. As soon as they have caught a
fish they kill it, by knocking its head against anything that may be near
them. The quantity of fish consumed by each bird is almost incredible&mdash;we
should think on the average not less than six ounces a day each;
they could not exist twenty-four hours without food, so they quickly digest
it. There can be no doubt that the sole reason of the kingfisher migrating
to the sea-side on the approach of severe weather, arises from the voracity
of its appetite.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are quite tame and domesticated, frequently sitting on the head
or shoulder of the person who is in the habit of cleaning out their little
dwelling. They are also very cleanly. We have observed them dive into
the water as many as forty times incessantly, for the purpose of washing&mdash;this
is generally done in the evening.</p>

<p>&#8220;Although they appear satisfied with their confinement, they are far from
being friendly with each other; they fight with their wings, something after the
manner of the swan; this is rather surprising, as they are very dexterous
with their bills when seizing their prey.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have tried to rear others in a common cage, feeding them partly on
flesh, but never succeeded.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Breeding.</span>&mdash;A hole at the edge of the water is the place in which it builds
its nest, which is formed on the outside of small roots, and lined with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>feathers. Its eggs in general are eight in number, and quite white. In the
young ones, before the feathers grow, the stubs are so long and straight that
they might be taken for so many little bristles. As soon as the young can
see clearly, and before the feathers begin to sprout, is the time to take them
from the nest; they must be fed first on ants&#8217; eggs, meal worms, and other
worms and afterwards accustomed by degrees to meat; they will be preserved
in good health for a much longer time, if care be taken always to give
them their food in fresh water, rather than let them pick it up from the
ground.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mode of taking.</span>&mdash;When the place which one of these birds frequents
most, and which is generally near an eddy in the water, is well known,
a stake must be fixed to which the snare, called a springe, can be fastened;
by this means the bird may be easily taken. Lime-twigs may also be put
on a bush or stake near the water&#8217;s edge, provided it does not hang so
much over the water as to risk the bird&#8217;s falling into it when fixed by the
lime.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attractive Qualities.</span>&mdash;Its great attractions are its beauty, for it is not
well proportioned, and all its motions are sudden.</p></div>

<h4>THE NUTHATCH.</h4>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;"><img src="images/i_099.png" alt="THE NUTHATCH." title="" height="204" width="250" /></div>

<p class="center">Sitta Europ&aelig;a, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; La Sittele, ou le Torchepot, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Der Nusshacker,
<span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> length of this bird is six inches and a half, of which
one and a half is included in the tail, and three-quarters in the
beak, which is strong, straight, a little flat at the tip; the eyes
are greyish brown; the feet yellowish grey, the claws very
strong. The forehead is blue only in the male; the rest of the
upper part of the body is of a blue grey; the cheeks and throat
are white; a black streak passing across the eyes extends from
the base of the beak to the neck; the belly and breast are of a
dingy orange colour.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Habitation.</span>&mdash;When wild it generally frequents woods. In the winter
it approaches villages, and will even fly into barns and stables.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span></p>

<p>In the house it must be kept in a cage made entirely of wire, as wood
cannot resist the strength of its beak<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">28</a>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Food.</span>&mdash;In its wild state it lives on insects, which it seeks for in the
trees, being able to cling to and run about the branches in any way: it
also eats nuts and beech mast, which it skilfully fixes in the chinks of the
trees, that it may crack them more easily.</p>

<p>In the house, it may be fed on hemp seed, oats, barley meal, or even
bread. The way in which it crushes the hemp seed and oats is very
curious; it takes as many as it can in its beak, and ranges them in order
in the cracks of the floor, always taking care to put the large end lowest,
that it may break them more easily; it then begins to despatch them one
after another with the greatest skill and agility.</p>

<p>The lady who has been occasionally mentioned in the introduction,
amused herself in the winter, and particularly when the snow was on the
ground, with throwing, several times a day, different kinds of seeds on the
terrace below the window, in order to feed the birds in the neighbourhood.
These soon became accustomed to this distribution, and arrived in crowds
when they heard the clapping of hands, which was the signal used to call
them. She put some hemp seed and cracked nuts even on the window-sill,
and on a board, particularly for her favourites, the blue tits. Two
nuthatches came one day to have their share in this repast, and were so
well pleased that they became quite familiar, and did not even go away in
the following spring, to get their natural food and to build their nest in
the wood. They settled themselves in the hollow of an old tree near the
house; as soon as the two young ones, which they reared here, were able
to fly, they brought them to the hospitable window where they were to be
nourished, and soon after disappeared entirely. It was very amusing to see
these two new visiters hang or climb on the wall or blinds, whilst their
benefactress put their food on the board. These pretty creatures, as well
as the tits, knew her so well, that when she drove away the sparrows which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>came to steal what was not intended for them, they did not fly away also,
but seemed to know that what was done was only to protect and defend
them.</p>

<p>These nuthatches remained near the house for the whole summer, rarely
wandering, till one fatal day, at the beginning of the sporting season, in
autumn, they no sooner heard the report of a gun than they disappeared,
and were never again seen. It is possible that fear alone had driven them
so far that they could not find their way home again; they did not know
that there they would have been in greater safety.</p>

<p>If these birds are left at liberty in the room, they are accustomed, like
the tits, to hide the greater part of what is given to them, to keep it for
another meal; but their trick of piercing holes in the wood makes them
inconvenient, and therefore it is better to keep them in a cage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Breeding.</span>&mdash;The nuthatch builds its nest in the holes of old trees, and
lays six or seven eggs spotted with red.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mode of Taking.</span>&mdash;As it has the same taste for hemp seed and oats as
the tits, it may often be caught in the same snare; it may also be taken in
the area or barn floor trap. Its call is &#8220;<i>gru, dek, dek</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attractive Qualities.</span>&mdash;Its plumage, liveliness, agility, and great
cunning in catching and hiding its food, are its most agreeable qualities.</p></div>

<h3>PASSERINE BIRDS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> birds of this group have the beak conical and pointed,
in general rather strong, with both the mandibles moveable,
and fit for peeling and cleaning grain. Their feet are slender,
and their claws divided. Some of them do not confine themselves
to grain, but also eat insects. Those which feed solely
on seeds disgorge them into the crop of their young, the others
simply put the food into their beaks. The greater part of
them build their nests very skilfully. The females brood
alone, or are very rarely assisted by the males in hatching.</p>

<p>This group and the following are peculiarly the real <i>cage
birds</i>; those pretty and attractive little creatures which enliven
our rooms with their songs.</p>

<p>Those which feed only on seeds may be tamed at any age.</p>

<h4>THE CROSSBILL.</h4>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;"><img src="images/i_103.png" alt="THE CROSSBILL." title="" height="183" width="250" /></div>

<p class="center">Loxia curvirostra, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; Le Beccrois&eacute;, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Der Kreuzschnabel,
<span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> length of this bird is nearly seven inches, of which the
tail measures two and a quarter. The beak, which is one inch
in length, and very thick, has its two mandibles curving in
opposite directions, and crossing each other at the points,
whence the name. It is no fixed rule for the upper mandible
to cross to the right or left, but its direction appears to be acquired
when young. The shanks, which are eight lines high,
and the beak, are brown; the iris is nut-coloured.</p>

<p>The change of colour, which some assert this bird is subject
to three times a year, simply occurs as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The young male, which is at first of a greyish brown, with
a little yellow, becomes after moulting entirely red, darker on
the upper part of the body than on the lower, the quill and tail
feathers excepted, which are blackish. This generally happens
in April or May. At the second moulting this red colour becomes
a greenish yellow, which is permanent; so that when
red they may be known to be the young male birds, and when
yellow the old ones.</p>

<p>The females are in general grey, with a little green on the
head, breast, and rump, or irregularly speckled with those two
colours.</p>

<p>From observations which have been made with great care
and exactness, and which any one can repeat who wishes, it
appears proved that an old male bird never changes its colour.
In order to be exact as to these facts, it is necessary to observe
the bird from the time of its leaving the nest; for, if one were
to judge from those taken in a snare, one would certainly be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
disposed to think that not one bird resembled another: but all
this variety depends on the different stages in moulting, which
so very much affects the colours of the plumage.</p>

<p>Thus, in old male birds the forehead, cheeks, and eyebrows
are spotted with grey, greenish yellow, and white. Wherever
green and yellow are prevalent, the dark grey shows through,
and has the appearance of spots on those parts, particularly on
the back, for the tips alone are green and yellow.</p>

<p>The result of all this is, that when grey or speckled crossbills
are spoken of, they are the young ones; when red, they have
passed their first moulting; when crimson, they are near their
second; and when spotted, red and yellow, they are two years
old, and in full feather. To judge with exactness, these birds
ought to be seen at the time of laying, but neither this nor the
moulting has any fixed season; and this circumstance sufficiently
explains the great variety and difference of colour which
are found among this species.</p>

<p>These details also show that the crossbill is subject to nearly
the same changes of colour as the linnet, and that the red colour
which it bears for the first year is what peculiarly distinguishes
it from other birds. One thing, which is rather remarkable,
is, that the young ones reared in the house never take the red
colour, but remain grey for the second year, or change directly
into greenish yellow.</p>

<p>There are two kinds of crossbills, the greater and lesser; but
the difference is not so great as some pretend, and nature is
not more invariable in the size of birds than it is in that
of men<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">29</a>.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Habitation.</span>&mdash;When wild, the crossbill not only inhabits Europe, but
also all the north of Asia and America, everywhere frequenting forests of
pines and firs, where these trees, which are loaded with cones, furnish abundance
of food.</p>

<p>In the house it may be let range at will, but a branch of fir, or any other
tree, must be put near it, on which it can perch or sleep. If it be kept in
a cage it must be made of wire; for, being so much disposed to peck and
nibble, a wicker cage would soon be reduced to chips.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Food.</span>&mdash;In its wild state the pine seed is its favourite food; the shape of
its beak is peculiarly adapted for procuring these seeds, by separating the
scales of the cones; it also gathers from the ground those which have fallen,
and it does not neglect those of the fir, and even of the alder. When these
fail it is contented with the buds of the same trees.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span></p>

<p>In the house, if it be let run about at liberty, the second universal paste
will be sufficient; but if kept in a cage it must be fed on hemp, pine, and
rape seed, and even elderberries.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Breeding.</span>&mdash;The time of breeding is very remarkable, being generally in
the depth of winter, from December to April. The nest, which is placed
at the top of a pine or fir tree, is first formed of very fine small twigs, there
is then a layer of coarse moss, but the interior is lined with the finest and
softest moss; it is not glued with resin, as some have said. The young
crossbills being in Thuringia the object of many ridiculous superstitions, the
wood-cutters are always careful of the nests. The number of the eggs
varies from three to five, they are of a greyish white, spotted, speckled, and
streaked at the large end with red brown. The heating nature of their
food enables the young and old birds to bear the severity of the season.
The old birds feed their young with the food disgorged from their own
stomach, as do all the grosbeaks. This species may be reared in the house
on white bread soaked in milk, and mixed with a few poppy-seeds.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diseases.</span>&mdash;The accumulated vapour from a room with a stove has such
an effect on the constitution of these birds, that they are almost always
ill<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">30</a>. Weak eyes, swelled and ulcerated feet, are very common occurrences;
hence the mountaineers of Thuringia have taken it into their heads that
these poor birds can take upon themselves their diseases and pains: and it
is this foolish idea that induces them always to keep one of these birds near
them. Their superstitious extravagance carries them so far, that they are
persuaded a bird whose upper mandible bends to the right, has the power of
assuming to itself the colds and rheumatism from men; but when this
mandible turns to the left, the bird renders the same service to the women.
These simple and credulous people imagine that nothing is more efficacious
against epilepsy, than every day to drink the water which the bird has left,
because they see that these unfortunate victims are often attacked with this
disease.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mode of Taking.</span>&mdash;With the decoy birds nothing is easier than to take
the crossbills in the autumn and spring: one large rod, covered with strong
bird-lime, is all that is necessary. It must be put in a glade in the wood
which these birds frequent, with the decoy bird by the side; this, by its
continual cry, will soon attract them. In Thuringia the people put nooses
and spring traps on the top of some of the highest pines, and there hang the
cage of the decoy bird; as soon as one crossbill has settled, the others follow;
so that as many birds are taken as there are traps set, particularly if
the stick of the spring traps be placed so that the bird must perch on it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attractive Qualities.</span>&mdash;The crossbill is rather a silly bird; in the cage
its motions are like those of the parrot; when lively it swings its body like
the siskin, and sings a few sharp strains, which are more or less monotonous,
according to the different powers of the songsters&mdash;for some of the males
far surpass the others in this short melody. It is easily tamed, can be
carried about anywhere on the finger, and will go and return again without
wandering.</p></div>

<h4>THE BULLFINCH.</h4>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;"><img src="images/i_106.png" alt="THE BULLFINCH." title="" height="162" width="250" /></div>

<p class="center">Loxia pyrrhula, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; Le Bouvreuil, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Der Gimpel, <span class="smcap">Bechstein.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> is one of the indigenous tame birds which is a favourite
with the rich and noble. Its body is thick and short. Its
whole length is six inches and three quarters, of which the tail
measures two and three quarters; the beak is only six lines in
length, short, thick, and black; the iris is chestnut-coloured;
the shanks eight lines high, and black; the top of the head, the
circle of the beak, the chin, and beginning of the throat, are of
a beautiful velvet black; the upper part of the neck, the back,
and shoulders, deep grey; the rump white; the under part of
the neck, the wide breast, and to the centre of the belly, are of
a fine vermilion, less bright, however, in the young than old;
the blackish pen-feathers become darker towards the body; the
secondaries have the outer edge of an iron blue, which in the
hinder ones is reddish. The tail is rather forked, and of a
brilliant black, tinged with iron blue.</p>

<p>The female is easily distinguished from the male, for what
is red on him is reddish grey on her, while her back is of a
brownish grey, and her feet are not so black; she is also
smaller.</p>

<p>This species has some singular varieties; the principal are:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The <i>White Bullfinch</i>, which is of an ashy white, or wholly
white, with dark spots on the back.</p>

<p>2. The <i>Black Bullfinch</i>. These are most generally females,
which become black, either with age, when they are only fed
on hemp seed, or with having been kept when young in a
totally dark place. Some resume at their moulting their
natural colours; others remain black; but this black is not
the same in all; some are of a brilliant raven black, others<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
dull, and not so dark on the belly; in some the head only is
of a raven black, the rest of the body being duller; in others
the black is mixed with red spots on the belly, or the latter is
entirely red. I have seen one in which the head and breast,
as well as the upper and under parts of the body, were of a raven
black, every other part of a dull black, with the wings and tail
white; it was a very handsome bird, rather larger than a red-breast.</p>

<p>3. The <i>Speckled Bullfinch</i>. It is thus called, for, besides its
natural colours, it is spotted with black and white, or white
and ash colour.</p>

<p>4. The <i>Mongrel Bullfinch</i>. It is the offspring of a female
reared in the house from the nest, and of a male canary. Its
shape and colour partake of those of the parent birds; its note
is very agreeable, and softer than that of the canary; but it is
very scarce. This union rarely succeeds; but when tried, a
very ardent and spirited canary should be chosen<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">31</a>.</p>

<p>5. The other varieties are: the <i>Large Bullfinch</i>, about the
size of a thrush, and the <i>Middling</i>, or <i>Common</i>. As to dwarf
birds, which are not as large as a chaffinch, it is a bird-catcher&#8217;r
story, for this difference in size is observed in all kinds of birds.
I can affirm it with the more certainty, having had opportunities
every year of seeing hundreds of these birds, both wild and
tame. I have even in the same nest found some as small as
red-breasts, and others as large as a crossbill.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Habitation.</span>&mdash;When wild, bullfinches are found over Europe and
Russia. They are particularly common in the mountainous forests of
Germany. The male and female never separate during the whole year.
In winter they wander about everywhere in search of buds.</p>

<p>In the house those which are caught in a snare are often let run about.
These birds not being very unruly or very active, a middling-sized cage
will do, in which those which have learned songs are kept; but they must
be kept in separate rooms, as they will mutually spoil their songs if left
together.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Food.</span>&mdash;When wild the bullfinch does not often suffer from the failure
of its food; for it eats pine and fir seeds, the fruit of the ash and maple,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>corn, all kinds of berries, the buds of the oak, beech, and pear trees, and
even linseed, millet, rape, and nettle seed.</p>

<p>In the house those which run about may be fed on the universal paste,
and, for a change, rape seed may be added; those which are taught must
be fed only on poppy seed, with a little hemp seed, and now and then a
little biscuit without spice. It has been remarked that those which are fed
entirely on rape seed soaked in water live much longer, and are more
healthy. The hemp seed is too heating, sooner or later blinds them, and
always brings on a decline. A little green food, such as lettuce, endive,
chickweed, water-cresses, a little apple, particularly the kernels, the berries
of the service tree, and the like, is agreeable and salutary to them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Breeding.</span>&mdash;These tenderly affectionate birds can hardly live when
separated from one another. They incessantly repeat their call with a
languishing note, and continually caress. They can sometimes be made to
breed in the house, like the canary, but their eggs are rarely fruitful. In
the wild state they breed twice every year, each time laying from three to
six eggs, of a bluish white, spotted with violet and brown at the large end.
Their nest, which they build in the most retired part of a wood, or in a
solitary quickset hedge, is constructed with little skill, of twigs which are
covered with moss. The young ones are hatched in fifteen days. Those
which are to be taught must be taken from the nest when the feathers of
the tail begin to grow; and must be fed only on rape seed soaked in water
and mixed with white bread; eggs would kill them or make them blind.
Their plumage is then of a dark ash-colour, with the wings and tail blackish
brown; the males may be known at first by their reddish breast; so that
when these only are wished to be reared they may be chosen in the nest,
for the females are not so beautiful, nor so easily taught.</p>

<p>Although they do not warble before they can feed themselves, one need
not wait for this to begin their instruction<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">32</a>, for it will succeed better, if one
may say so, when infused with their food; since experience proves that
they learn those airs more quickly, and remember them better, which they
have been taught just after eating. It has been observed several times,
that these birds, like the parrots, are never more attentive than during
digestion. Nine months of regular and continued instruction are necessary
before the bird acquires what amateurs call firmness, for if one ceases before
this time, they spoil the air, by suppressing or displacing the different parts,
and they often forget it entirely at their first moulting. In general it is a
good thing to separate them from the other birds, even after they are perfect;
because, owing to their great quickness in learning, they would spoil
the air entirely by introducing wrong passages; they must be helped to
continue the song when they stop, and the lesson must always be repeated
whilst they are moulting, otherwise they will become mere chatterers,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>which would be doubly vexatious after having had much trouble in teaching
them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diseases.</span>&mdash;Those bullfinches which are caught in a snare or net are
rarely ill, and may be preserved for eight years or more; but those reared
from the nest are subject to many diseases, caused by their not having
their natural food, or by those injurious delicacies which are always lavished
on favourite birds; they rarely live more than six years. The surest
means of preserving them healthy for a long time, is to give them neither
sweets nor tit-bits of any kind, scrupulously to confine their food to rape
seed, adding now and then a very little hemp seed to please them, and a good
deal of the green food before mentioned. The bottom of their cages should
be covered with river sand, as the bird there finds some stones which aid
the functions of the stomach. Their most frequent diseases are moulting,
costiveness, diarrh&oelig;a, epilepsy, grief, and melancholy, in which case they
are quite silent, and remain immoveable, unless the cause can be discovered.
They must not be given any delicacy, and must be fed entirely on soaked
rape seed. A clove in their water, proper food, and particularly a good deal
of refreshing green food, enables them to pass the moulting time in good
health.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mode of Taking.</span>&mdash;There are few birds so easily attracted by the decoy
bird as bullfinches. They may also be taken by any of the usual means.
In winter numbers may be caught by a noose, by hanging to it such berries
as the bird likes; in spring and autumn they may be caught in the area or
barn floor trap; and provided they see berries there, the decoy bird is not
wanted; it is sufficient if one imitates their soft cry of &#8220;<i>tui, tui</i>,&#8221; in
the hut.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attractive Qualities.</span>&mdash;Although the song of the male and female
bullfinch, in their wild state, is very harsh and disagreeable, yet if well
taught while young, as they are in Hesse and Fulda, where there are schools
of these little musicians, for all Germany, Holland, and England, they
learn to whistle all kinds of airs and melodies with so soft and flute-like a
tone, that they are great favourites with amateurs, and particularly with the
ladies. There are some of these little birds which can whistle distinctly
three different airs, without spoiling or confusing them in the least. Added
to this attraction the bullfinch becomes exceedingly tame, sings whenever
it is told to do so, and is susceptible of a most tender and lasting attachment,
which it shows by its endearing actions; it balances its body, moves
its tail from right to left, and spreads it like a fan. It will even repeat
words, with an accent and tone which indicates sensibility, if one could
believe that it understood them; but its memory must not be overloaded.
A single air, with a prelude or a short flourish to begin with, is as much as
the bird can learn and remember, and this it will execute to the greatest
perfection. These little prodigies would be more interesting and agreeable,
if their Hessian instructors possessed a little musical taste, but these are
generally tradespeople, employed about the house with their different
occupations and trades; and hymns, airs, and minuets of a hundred years
old, public house songs, or some learnt of their apprentices, in general compose
the whole of their music.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span></p>

<p>The bullfinch can also imitate the songs of other birds; but in general it
is not permitted to do so, that it may only learn to repeat the airs which
are taught it.</p>

<p>Different degrees of capacity are shown here, as well as in other animals.
One young bullfinch learns with ease and quickness, another with difficulty
and slowly; the former will repeat, without hesitation, several parts
of a song; the latter will be hardly able to whistle one, after nine months'
uninterrupted teaching. But it has been remarked that those birds which
learn with most difficulty remember the songs, which have once been well
learnt, better and longer, and rarely forget them, even when moulting.
Mr. Thiem<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">33</a>, bird-seller, at Waltershausen, near Gotha, sends annually
to Berlin and London one or two hundred bullfinches, instructed in this
manner, at from one to several pounds sterling a-piece, according as they
are more or less accomplished, whilst a wild one would cost only two or
three pence. These, however, are also kept in the room and prized, both
on account of their beauty and the great ease with which they are tamed;
they soon learn to fly on the hand, to receive their food, or will even take
it from the mouth, and become at last as familiar as if they had been
reared from the nest. The following are the means which are employed
to tame them:&mdash;As soon as a bullfinch is caught and brought into the room,
it must be put into a cage with food sufficient for the first day only; for
the loss of its liberty does not prevent its eating as soon as it is disengaged
from the lime twigs or noose. The next day a band must be put round
the body and wings, like that which bird-catchers put round a decoy bird,
which they let run about out of doors; by means of this band the bullfinch
may be fastened by a piece of packthread, a foot in length, to some place
from which it cannot fall; this will prevent its beating itself to death with its
wings; a little bell may be fastened to a box, which when filled with food must
be given to the bird, at the same time ringing the bell; it must be then left
that it may eat; this must be repeated several times in the day; the same
must be done when it is given anything to drink. The poor little captive
will not at first either eat or drink in any one&#8217;s presence; it is therefore
necessary to retire for the two first days after having given it the box, and
only approach it by degrees, till it is accustomed to eat in the presence
of its master, which it will soon be, for generally on the third day,
as soon as it hears the bell and sees the box, it hops forward, and eats
without the least shyness. Then the distance must be increased by degrees
to make it come farther and farther, when, as soon as it has eaten, it may
be taken on the hand and carried here and there, though it may seem a
little frightened, but not being able to escape it will soon become used to
this treatment, and will even begin to come to eat on the hand by continuing
to do this for the third and fourth days; it will fly of itself at the
sound of the bell to the hand which holds the box; after this the fastening
may be loosened, and if one only move from the bird gradually, it will
fearlessly approach and perch on the hand. Should it escape, however,
it must be again confined and left without food for some hours. By this
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>means a wild bullfinch will in eight days become accustomed to fly immediately
to the hand, or wherever it hears the bell; in order to finish its
education, it is well to increase the difficulty of getting at its food, by
putting it in a small bag with a very little opening; it must also only
have rape seed in the cage, keeping the hemp seed, which it likes best, for
the hand or little bag. It may be taught to drink out of one&#8217;s mouth
by keeping it without water for five or six hours. It may even be accustomed
to go and return, provided the house is not too near a wood. The surest
means of preventing too long an absence is to put a female bullfinch in a
cage in the window, or to leave her in the room with her wing clipped; its
affection will soon bring it back to her, and it will certainly never
abandon her altogether.</p>

<p>Tame bullfinches have been known (says Buffon) to escape from the
aviary, and live at liberty in the woods for a whole year, and then to
recollect the voice of the person who had reared them, return to her, never
more to leave her. Others have been known, which when forced to leave
their first master, have died of grief. These birds remember very well,
and often too well, any one who has injured them. One of them having
been thrown down, with its cage, by some of the lowest order of people, did
not seem at first much disturbed by it, but afterwards it would fall into convulsions
as soon as it saw any shabbily dressed person, and it died in one of
these fits eight months after the first accident.</p>

<p>A bullfinch, belonging to a lady often mentioned before, being subject to
very frightful dreams, which made it fall from its perch, and beat itself in
the cage, no sooner heard the affectionate voice of its mistress than, notwithstanding
the darkness of the night, it became immediately tranquil, and
re-ascended its perch to sleep again. It was very fond of chickweed, and as
soon as it perceived one bringing it to him, however much care was taken
to prevent its finding it easily, it would show its joy by its actions and
cries.</p></div>

<h4>THE GREEN BIRD.</h4>

<p class="center">Loxia chloris, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; Le Verdier, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Der Gr&uuml;nling, <span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> bird is rather larger than the chaffinch, being six inches
in length, of which the tail measures two and a half; the beak
five lines in length. The iris is dark brown; the shanks are
eight inches in height, and of a bluish flesh colour. The prevailing
colour of the plumage is yellowish green, lighter on the
lower part of the body, still more so on the rump and breast, and
shading to white on the belly.</p>

<p>The female, which is smaller, is still more distinguished by
the greenish brown of the upper part, and the ash-colour rather
than yellowish green of the lower part of the body; she has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
besides some yellow spots on the breast, and the whole belly is
rather white than yellow.</p>

<p>Sportsmen and bird-catchers mention three kinds of green
birds, namely, the large, which is everywhere of a beautiful
yellow; the middle sized, the under part of the body of which
is light yellow; and the little, which they say is rather greenish
than yellow; but all this variety depends upon the different
ages of the bird, as well as its strength, and more or less beautiful
tints of its plumage. What much more deserves to be
remarked is the mule, which is the offspring of a green bird,
and a female canary; it has a strong body; its colours are green
and grey, mixed with yellow, when the female canary is yellow;
but it is always a bad singer.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Habitation.</span>&mdash;When wild, the green bird may be found over all Europe,
though not often far north. It may be seen during summer, in hedges,
and on the borders of woods, and always where there are several trees near
together; during winter it wanders into different provinces, in large and
numerous flocks; but in March it begins to return from these journeys.</p>

<p>In the house it may either be let range free, or be shut up in an aviary
with other birds, where it is always very peaceable as long as it has sufficient
food; but when that fails, it perches itself on the general food-drawer,
and keeps it determinedly, pecking it with its beak so cleverly that no other
bird can approach: should one venture, it is soon obliged to go away or
lose its feathers; otherwise this bird is as quiet and tame in the house as
it is wild and active when at liberty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Food.</span>&mdash;In its wild state it seems to like all kinds of seed, even that of
the milk thistle, which all other birds dislike.</p>

<p>In the house, when it ranges at will, the second universal paste so well
agrees with it that it becomes quite fat; however, as a variety, rape and
hemp seed may be thrown to it; if in a cage it must only be fed in summer
with rape seed, except a little hemp seed, which may be given after moulting,
to make it sing. Lettuce, chickweed and other green food, always agree
with it, and even the berries of the juniper tree.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Breeding.</span>&mdash;Its nest, which is almost always placed in a hedge, on a
large branch near the trunk of a tree, or on the top of an old willow-tree,
is firmly built with wool, moss, and lichen, and lined with very fine roots
and bristles. The female lays, twice a year, four or five pointed eggs, of a
silver hue, spotted with light violet or brown. The young are at first of
a greenish grey; some yellow tints, however, may already be seen in the
male. When reared from the nest, it learns, though with difficulty, to
imitate the different songs of house-birds; and, as it almost always happens
with slow memories, having once learnt a thing it never forgets it. It also
sings through the whole year; it should therefore be taught by a bird whose
song is agreeable, for instance, a chaffinch, and then one would have the
pleasure of hearing it without interruption through all the seasons.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diseases.</span>&mdash;The constitution of the green bird being very strong and
healthy, it is rarely subject to disease. It may be kept in good health for
twelve years.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mode of Taking.</span>&mdash;If the decoy bird be a good one, the green bird may
be easily caught in the area or barn-floor trap, even in December. In the
spring it may be taken with bird-lime on the lure-bush, when a linnet will
do for the songstress. In order to make it eat soon, a little crushed hemp
seed should be thrown in the bottom of its cage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attractive Qualities.</span>&mdash;Without being handsome its song is not disagreeable;
it may also be taught to repeat words; but its greatest merit is
the wonderful ease with which it is tamed, equalling, and even surpassing
the bullfinch in this particular. It may not only be accustomed to go and
return again, but also to build in a room near an orchard, or in a summer-house
in the garden. The following are the means which must be taken
to make it do this:&mdash;</p>

<p>After having taken the young from the nest they must be put in a cage,
and placed at the foot of the tree in which this nest is built, in a place
dug for the purpose, and on the cage a tit as a decoy. When left there,
the old birds come to feed their young, and are caught in the snare. As
soon as they are taken, they must all be brought into the house, where the
old and young must be put together in any aviary, or large cage, till the
latter can fly; the window may then be opened for them to go out, but
hunger will soon bring them back. As soon as they have exercised their
wings, the old birds should be placed on the table in the window to call
them back. In time, they become so familiar that they will accompany
one in a walk, and there is no fear of their flying away. If they are not
taken thus, it is necessary to wait for winter and snow to let them go out,
and if they profit by the permission, to call them back by some of their
species placed in a cage in the window. If you wish to be quite sure of
success, you have only to put a board in the window, on which two females
with their wings cut, can run about, go out, and return.</p>

<p>The green bird likes to build near canaries, and as these are good nurses,
they are given the eggs of the green bird, which, like the goldfinches and
siskins, learns to draw up its water and food.</p></div>

<h4>THE PINE GROSBEAK.</h4>

<p class="center">Loxia Enuclator, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; Le Durbec, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Der Fichtenkernbeisser,
<span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> is one of the largest species of grosbeak that we have,
equalling the Bohemian chatterer in size. Its length is eight
inches and a half, of which the tail measures three; the beak
is short and thick, measuring only six lines; its colour is
brown, the iris dark brown; the feet are from twelve to
thirteen lines high, and blackish; the head, neck, breast and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
rump are of a light vermilion, with bluish tints; the feathers
on the back and the lesser wing coverts are black, with reddish
edges.</p>

<p>The female is generally of a greyish green, with some
scattered reddish and yellowish tints, principally on the top of
the head. It is not yet well known if this bird has the same
changes of colour as the crossbill, since more yellow ones have
been found than red. Experience shows that the same things
take place in the house as out of doors. They acquire the
yellow red, not only after the first moulting, but even before it.
This change begins first round the beak, descends afterwards
to the back and breast, and at last gradually extends over the
whole body, so that what was red before becomes yellow; this
yellow is darker than citron; all the red and yellow feathers
are ash-colour at the base. The young are brownish, with a
slight shade of yellow. During the first year the colour of the
males is light red; it is only after this that they become darker
vermilion or crimson; these birds are caught in autumn and
winter, either in the noose or net, with elder or service berries
as a lure.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Observations.</span>&mdash;This bird is found in all the northern regions of Europe,
Asia, and America, and in Europe rarely passes the fifty-third degree of
latitude. It frequents the pine and fir forests, the seeds of which form its
food; in winter it quits these places in search of berries; this is what ranks
it among the erratic birds. They are so stupid, that in the north they are
easily caught with a circle of brass wire fixed to the end of a long pole, to
which are fastened some horse-hair rings, which are simply passed over the
head of the bird. They are often caught and kept in cages, as they are
liked, both on account of the ease with which they are tamed, and of their
song, which is very agreeable; they will even sometimes sing in the night,
and always preserve their song through the whole year, while the wild only
sing in the spring.</p></div>

<h4>HAWFINCH.</h4>

<span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> must be a very great bird fancier to wish to have this
bird in the house. Its length is seven inches, of which the
tail measures two inches and a third. The beak, which is very
thick in proportion to the rest of the body, is like a large blunt
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>cone, dark blue in summer, and flesh-coloured, with the tip
black, in winter; the slim feet are nine lines in height, and of
a pale crimson; the yellowish brown of the forehead unites
with the light chestnut on the top of the head and cheeks; the
circle of the head is black, and forms, under the chin, a large
square spot; the nape of the neck and upper part of the back
are of a fine ash-grey, the lower part is of a dark brown, with
some shades of grey on the rump.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><img src="images/i_116.png" alt="BREEDING CAGE." title="" height="705" width="500" />
<p class="caption">BREEDING CAGE.</p></div>

<p>In the females, the cheeks, head, and upper tail coverts are
of a greyish chestnut colour; the throat, wings, and tail rather
brown than black, the spot on the wings greyish, the under part
of the body reddish grey, shading to white on the belly.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Habitation.</span>&mdash;When wild, it may be found in all the temperate parts
of Europe and Russia. It is very common among the mountainous countries
of Germany, where the beech prevails in the forests. It is rather an
erratic bird than a bird of passage, and its excursions are ended in March.
Sonnini says, however, that he has seen it during winter, in Egypt, with
the blackbirds and thrushes, and its excursions are ended in March.</p>

<p>In the house it is generally kept in a large wire cage, where it is soon
tamed. It may also be let run about, provided it has not too many companions,
and that it has food in abundance, for it is a very quarrelsome
bird.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Food.</span>&mdash;In its wild state it eats many different things; the fruit of the
beech, elm, ash, and maple; the berries of the juniper, service-tree, and
white-thorn; cherries and plums, the stones of which it breaks with the
greatest ease, to eat the kernel; hemp seed, cabbage, radish, and lettuce
seed also form a part of its food.</p>

<p>In the house, if confined in the cage, it is contented with rape and
hemp-seed; and if it run about, with the second universal paste.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Breeding.</span>&mdash;Its nest is well built; the eggs, from three to five in
number, are greenish grey, spotted with brown, and streaked with blackish
blue. The young, when reared from the nest, will become so tame as to
eat from the hand, and will courageously defend itself with its beak against
the dogs and cats; it may also be accustomed to go and come.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mode of Taking.</span>&mdash;The haste with which these birds come on hearing
the call, makes it very easy to catch them in the net, by throwing berries
or hemp seed on the trap. In autumn and winter they may be taken by
the noose, with service-berries; in spring they may be caught by placing
lime twigs on the nest. The loss of their liberty does not prevent their
eating immediately rape or hemp seed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attractive Qualities.</span>&mdash;I confess that it has very few; its song is less
agreeable than any of the others', it is a kind of low whistling, mixed with
some harsh tones; but its great tameness may please; it is necessary,
however, to guard one&#8217;s self from its beak.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> length of this bird is eight inches, of which the tail
measures three. Its beak is strong and light red, like its feet;
the iris is dark brown; the head is ornamented with a tuft,
which, when raised, is pointed; the throat and the part round
the beak are black; the rest of the body is of a beautiful bright
red; the pen and tail-feathers are less brilliant, and brown on
the anterior part.</p>

<p>The female is in general of a reddish brown.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Observations.</span>&mdash;The beautiful song of this grosbeak is so like that of
the nightingale, that this name has been given it; but its voice is so strong
that it pierces the ears. It sings through the whole year, except during
the time of moulting.</p>

<p>In its wild state, its principal food is the seed of the Indian corn and
buck-wheat; it collects a considerable quantity of this food, which it skilfully
covers with leaves and twigs, only leaving a very small hole, as the
entrance to this magazine. In the cage it is fed with millet, rape seed,
hemp seed, and the like, which agree with it very well.</p>

<p>Some persons have endeavoured to make it breed in large aviaries in
the middle of gardens, but I do not know that it has ever succeeded. In
Germany it is very dear, being as much as six or eight pounds sterling for
a pair.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> bird is about the size of a bullfinch, and five inches in

and of a fine rose colour; the feet are paler; the eyelids naked,

which surrounds the cheeks, are black; the cheeks are white;
the rump, tail, and greater pen-feathers are black, but all the
rest of the upper part of the body, the wing-coverts, hinder
pen-feathers, and breast, are of a dark grey; the belly purple
grey; the lower tail-coverts white. &#8220;The whole plumage,&#8221;
says Buffon, &#8220;is so well arranged, that no one feather passes
another, and they all appear downy, or rather covered with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
that kind of bloom which you see on plums; this gives them a
very beautiful tint.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the female the colours are rather lighter on the back and
belly: the young are not only paler, but also irregularly spotted
with dark brown on the cheeks and lower part of the belly.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Observations.</span>&mdash;There are few vessels coming from Java and the Cape
of Good Hope that do not bring numbers of these birds, which have as
bad a character in those countries, and particularly in China, their native
place, as the sparrows have amongst us, on account of the ravages they
make in the rice fields. They have nothing attractive but their beauty,
for their song is short and monotonous. They cost four or five pounds
sterling a pair in Germany.</p></div>

<h4>THE WAXBILL.</h4>

<span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> bird is hardly larger than a golden-crested wren, its
length being four inches and a half, of which the tail measures
two inches; the beak is rather rough at the base, and of a dark
red; the band which crosses the eyes, the centre of the breast
and belly, are red; the upper part of the body is brown, and
the lower reddish grey, the whole streaked with transverse
blackish lines, which become finer as they approach the head;
the quill-feathers are brown, as well as the tail, which is
wedge-shaped, and streaked with darker transverse lines; the
feet are brown. These birds change colour like the amandava
finch; thus some are found with the tail entirely brown,
others which have the rump crimson, and the rest of the body
brown above and white below, and some have the belly yellow,
and the back spotted with white; there are some, indeed,
which have the neck and throat bluish, the under part of the
body white, mixed with iron colour, and the upper part blue.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Observations.</span>&mdash;They inhabit the Canary Islands, Senegal, Angola, the
Cape of Good Hope, and may even be found as far as India, whence they
are brought to Europe. Their beautiful shape, their amiable disposition,
and the affection which they show to every one indiscriminately, render
them such favourites, that a dozen may be often seen in one cage. Their
song is scarcely any thing. They are fed on millet, which also forms their
food in their native country, to the damage of the fields which are sown
with it. They approach villages like our sparrows; they are caught in
traps made of the shell of a gourd, and cut like a bowl, on which some
millet is scattered.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> beautiful little bird, which is brought to Europe in
great numbers from Bengal, Java, Malacca, and other tropical
countries of Asia, is only four inches long, of which the tail
measures one and a third. Most ornithologists class it with
the sparrows, but it seems to me that it belongs rather to the
grosbeaks. Its beak is short and thick, being only four lines
in length, and the diameter at the base measuring three. Its
colour is deep bright red; the iris is also red; the feet are six
lines in height, and of a pale flesh-colour; in the male the head
and under part of the body are of a fiery red, the upper part of
a dark grey, but the feathers have a broad red edge, so that
this colour seems to prevail; thus the edge of the feathers on
the rump make it appear of a brilliant orange, though, like the
belly, it is properly black; the feathers of the back, tail, sides
of the breast and belly, the wing-coverts, hinder quill-feathers,
and both tail-coverts, are terminated at the tip with shining
white spots, which are largest on the hinder quill-feathers, and
larger wing-coverts, the colour of which is otherwise black.</p>

<p>The female is one third smaller than the male; part of the
upper mandible is black; the head and upper part of the body,
including the wing-coverts, are of a dark ash-colour; the feathers
on the rump have only an orange edge, with a light tip;
the cheeks are of a light grey; the under part of the body is
pale sulphur, the pen-feathers blackish; the greater and lesser
wing-coverts are finely speckled with white; the tips of the
tail-feathers are greyish white.</p>

<p>The male varies in its colours for several years before it
permanently acquires those above described: it may be seen
with the back grey, slightly tinted with red, the belly black,
speckled with yellow; others with the back reddish grey,
spotted with bright red, and the belly of a sulphur yellow,
with black rings, and more or less speckled, &amp;c.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Observations.</span>&mdash;These birds are as sociable as the waxbills; if there
should be twenty or thirty in the same cage, they perch close against one
another on the same perch; and, what is more singular, they never sing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>together, but one after another, the rest keeping quite silent to listen to the
songster. Their song resembles that of the hay bird, and continues through
the winter. The females do not sing; those are wrong who think the contrary.
They are very active, often bowing and spreading their tail like a
fan. In their native country their food consists of different seeds, particularly
millet; this is also given it in the cage, as well as canary seed.
They eat and drink a great deal. They will live from six to ten years.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> species is about six inches long; the beak and feet are
flesh-coloured, the head and chin red; the upper part of the
neck, the back, rump, and wing-coverts, bluish grey; the upper

white, with dark brown spots on the sides; the wing-coverts
white at the tip, which forms two transverse streaks on the

lighter tips. The female does not differ from the male.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Observations.</span>&mdash;The male sings through the whole year, but its voice is

The feet are nine lines in height, the middle claw measures five

at the forehead, and of a dark blood red; the feet are of a very
red colour, the claws black; the eyelids red, and irides orange;
the circle of the beak, including the forehead, eyes, and chin,
is black; the top of the head rust-colour, more or less approaching
to red, scattered with blackish spots, formed by the black
of the feathers; the under part of the body of a brownish red,
clouded with white, and lighter on the sides and the lower part<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
of the belly, the whole spotted with black in the young birds,
but with no spots in the old ones.</p>

<p>The female is altogether lighter, and has no black on the
head, but two dark grey streaks above and under the eyes; the
under part of the body is only reddish grey.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Observations.</span>&mdash;This species is found on the coasts of Africa, in Bengal,
and other parts of Asia. It is a very agreeable bird, and though its voice
is weak its song is only the more melodious. A male and female put
together in a cage seem to be taken up with their mutual affection, always
feeding and caressing each other. They are fed on crushed canary and
hemp seed, which preserves them in good health for several years. The
room in which they are kept must be heated during winter.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> bird is about the size of a sparrow. The beak is black;
iris chestnut; feet dark flesh-colour; forehead, sides of the
head, chin, lower part of the breast and belly blackish; the
throat, top of the head and breast, rump, vent, and tail are of a
fiery red, or brilliant carmine, and soft, like velvet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Varieties.</span>&mdash;1. A black spot on the chin; thighs red.</p>

<p>2. Tail dark brown, with a greyish white border.</p>

<p>In the female the beak is raven black, the upper part of the
body dark brown, with light grey edges to the feathers; the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
head dark grey, with a whitish streak which passes above the
eyes; the under part of the body light grey. From this it
seems to be very like the house sparrow; its plumage is, however,
altogether lighter.</p>

<p>The male takes these colours, in the house, at the second
moulting, but the streaks are darker, the feathers of the upper
part of the body being blackish, with broad borders of reddish
grey; the streak above the eyes is of a pale sulphur. When
wild, the males, immediately after pairing, which is in January,
lose their red feathers, and become like the females, but have
them again in July, about the time of the second breeding
season. They are pretty whilst moulting, when the head and
body are speckled, the tail and neck still remaining red.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Observations.</span>&mdash;These birds, which are very numerous in all the colonies
at the Cape of Good Hope, do as much mischief there to the flowers and
ears of corn, as the sparrows do in Europe. When retiring by thousands
in the evening, from the fields to the reeds, they make such a noise with
their chirping as may be heard to a great distance. Their call is like the
sparrows&#8217; &#8220;<i>dib, dib</i>,&#8221; and their song as weak as that of the siskin; the
nest is skilfully constructed with small twigs interwoven with cotton, and
has but one opening, with two compartments, one above the other, the
upper for the male and the lower for the female; the eggs are green.</p>

<p>These birds, when kept in a cage, are fed on canary seed. The male
and female never like to be separated; there is no instance, however, of
their breeding in these climates.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">I have</span> one of these birds, which is about the size of a bullfinch:
its length is six inches and a quarter, of which the tail,
which is rather wedge-shaped, measures two and a half. The
beak is whitish above, very much compressed on the sides, and
very pointed; the iris dark brown; feet dark flesh-colour.
The head, neck, top of the back, all the under part of the body,
and the tail are of a fine velvet black.</p>

<p>The female, which is light brown, has a black spot in the
centre of each feather; the sides of the head and greater wing-coverts
are grey white, streaked with black; the lesser coverts
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
and the rump of a light yellow; the tail-feathers edged with
grey; the beak pale or raven grey.</p>

<p>The plumage of the male after pairing is like that of the
female.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Observations.</span>&mdash;This bird, which comes from the Cape of Good Hope
lives very well in the house; it is kept in a cage, alone or with the female,
and fed with hemp and canary seed. In its native country it frequents the

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> bird is very little larger than the bullfinch, but its
long and raised tail is about twice the length of its body: it is
only ornamented with it during the pairing season. The beak
is brown grey; the feet grey; the prevailing colour of the
plumage is velvet black; the shoulders are red; the coverts
white; the pen-feathers brown grey, with a white border.</p>

<p>The female is always grey, and has only a little red on the
shoulders. The male acquires its beautiful black plumage at
the beginning of November, and loses it in January, to assume
the colours of the female.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Observations.</span>&mdash;This species, which is found in the interior of the
country north of the Cape, lives and builds in marshes: it is rarely
brought to Europe. The long tail of the male requires a large cage in order
to preserve its beauty. In its wild state this length of tail is very inconvenient
during the high winds; and during the rainy season it may be
caught by the hand. It is fed with canary seed.</p></div>

<p>The following is mentioned as a <i>variety</i>.</p>

<p>The Chinese Grosbeak (<i>Brisson&#8217;s Ornithology</i>, III., <i>page</i> 235,
<i>No.</i> 7), with the head, throat, and front of the neck black, the
upper part of the body red brown or chestnut, the wings and
tail similar to the one above.</p>

<p>I have seen this bird in a room several times, and have always
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
regarded it as a male, on account of its song, and because, after
moulting, its plumage returned unaltered, not becoming either
white on the breast or black at the vent.</p>

<p>Edwards, who has represented it in his 355th plate, has
added a female, which he kept in the same cage, and which
was improved by its companion. The upper part of its body
was grey brown, the sides of the head and under part of the
body pinkish, or rather blush colour, the wing and tail feathers
blackish, the feet flesh-colour.</p>

<p>The blackness of the wings and tail makes me suspect that
this female belongs to another species; its attachment and
familiarity prove nothing. We know, in fact, that nearly all
granivorous birds hold communion together, and mutually
caress each other with the bill.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Observations.</span>&mdash;The Malacca Finch comes from the East Indies: it is

pronounced in a loud clear tone. Though its song is somewhat nasal and
rather noisy, it is not disagreeable.</p>

<p>Its food, when in confinement, is hemp and canary seed, which I have
known preserve it for a long time in good health.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Naturalists</span> say that the plumage of this bird differs considerably
in summer and winter; though, from analogy with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
others of its species, I am authorized in suspecting that this
change arises rather from age. I shall leave the question
undecided; and since we can never see this bird when it has
retired in summer within the arctic circle, its native home, I
shall content myself with describing its winter colours, such as
we may see them in a room.</p>

<p>It is the size of a lark, six inches and a half in length, of
which the tail measures two and two-thirds. The beak is five
or six lines in length, with every characteristic of the bunting
species, conical in form, rather bent at the sides, and having a
bony tubercle like a grain of barley at the palate; its colour in
the singing season is quite black, at other times the point alone
is black, the rest yellow. The back and rump are black, the
feathers of the back being edged with white, whilst those of the
rump and scapulars are edged with yellowish brown, darker in
spring than summer.</p>

<p>The female is rather smaller, the head and upper part of the
neck white, with a mixture of cinnamon-brown, and transverse
spots of the same colour form a kind of broken band across
the white breast.</p>

<p>The young ones which are taken in winter are known by their
dark brown beak; the lower part of the back is of the same
colour, but their feathers are edged with a light grey. The
male has the head most speckled with yellow brown, the cheeks
of the female are of the same tint, and it has spots of this on
the breast.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Observations.</span>&mdash;When the winter is severe, these birds are seen from
December to May in many parts of Germany, where they even approach
the villages. I am persuaded that, if attention were paid to them, they
might be seen in every direction, during March, on their passage to the North;
whilst snow is on the ground they are found in company with larks, on the
high roads and in the fields; they may then be taken with horse dung, placed in
net, or covered with bird-lime, or by clearing a spot of ground of snow and
strewing it with oats. I have had a pair six years in my room without a cage,
and they are satisfied with the food common for other birds: if kept in a cage,
they must be fed on hemp seed, oats, millet, rape, and poppy seeds. They
appear much delighted whilst bathing; during the night they seem very
uneasy, hopping and running about continually. Their strong and piercing
cry resembles a loud whistle; their song would be rather agreeable were it
not interrupted in a peculiar manner; it is a warbling mingled with some
high noisy notes, descending slowly from shrill to deep, and a little strong
and broken whistling. Heat is so contrary to their nature, that they cannot
be preserved unless carefully guarded from it.</p></div>

<h4>THE MOUNTAIN BUNTING.</h4>

<p class="center">Emberiza montana, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; L&#8217;Lrtolan de Montagne, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Der Bergammer,
<span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> bird is smaller than the snow bunting, has a short,
strong yellow beak, with a black point; the head is nearly flat,
the frontal band light chestnut; the upper part of the neck and
back grey, with black streaks, most numerous on the back,
causing a resemblance to the female yellowhammer; feet
black.</p>

<p>The breast of the female is of a deeper colour than the male&#8217;e.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Observations.</span>&mdash;This species, inhabiting the cold regions of Europe, is
never found in great numbers. In Thuringia, and some other provinces of
Germany, they are seen generally every year, in March, the time of
passage, settling in pairs along the high roads, searching for a few undigested
grains in the dung of animals. Their song is shrill, tolerably pleasing, and
interrupted like the yellowhammer&#8217;r. They may be easily kept in the
house, either caged or not, feeding them on oats, bread, hemp, and other
seeds. These birds also appear uneasy during the night, especially in the
pairing season, uttering their call amidst the darkness. Some are occasionally
met with of a dull orange on the upper part of the body, streaked with
yellow on the head, and deep orange on the back. These are young birds.
This species is caught in the same manner as the snow bunting.</p></div>

<h4>THE YELLOWHAMMER.</h4>

<p class="center">Emberiza citrinella, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; Le Bruant, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Der Goldammer, <span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">However</span> well known this bird may be, it is still necessary
that it should be described minutely, as the young males and
old females are often confounded with one another. It is six
inches and a half in length, of which the forked tail measures
three. The beak, five lines long, is dark brown in summer,
and ash grey in winter; the feet are of a light brown. The
head of the old males is of a fine yellow, generally having
some streaks of dark olive scattered over the top and on the
cheeks; it is only in very old birds that the head and neck
are of a golden yellow, without any mixture; the upper part
of the neck is olive; the back black, mingled with reddish
grey; the feathers have black up the middle, and the edges
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
reddish grey; the rump is of a deep red; the throat, with the
under part of the neck and the belly, are yellow, more or less
golden; the breast, especially its sides, as well as the small
coverts of the tail, is streaked with yellow and red.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><img src="images/i_131.png" alt="YELLOWHAMMER." title="" height="762" width="500" />
<p class="caption">YELLOWHAMMER.</p></div>

<p>The female is rather smaller than the male; the yellow of
the head, neck, and throat, is scarcely seen through the spots
scattered over it, which are brown on the head and cheeks, and
olive-coloured on the neck; the breast is only speckled with
rust red, and the wing coverts with reddish white, so that at a
distance it appears rather brown than yellow.</p>

<p>Young male birds, in spring, scarcely differ from old females,
except that a spot of yellow may even then be seen on the top
of the head, as well as a streak of the same colour above the
eyes and on the throat; in fact, the breast and rump are
rather of a deep reddish brown than rust red, and also without
spots.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Habitation.</span>&mdash;In its wild state the yellowhammer is found in all parts
of Europe, and the north of Asia. It remains in summer about the skirts
of forests and small woods. It overruns the fields in autumn, and in the
winter approaches our buildings, particularly barns and stables.</p>

<p>When confined it is generally allowed to run about the room, but where
it is rare, and therefore most valued, it is kept in a cage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Food.</span>&mdash;When wild these birds live on insects, particularly caterpillars,
on which, like all the other species of this genus, they feed their young.
In autumn and winter, they have recourse to all kinds of grain; but they
prefer oats, which, with barley, wheat, and millet, they know how to get at
very cleverly, notwithstanding the bony tubercle at their palate. They
also feed upon rape, and other small seeds, when they can get them.</p>

<p>In the house, to preserve them in health, their food should be properly
varied, giving them in turn oats, the crumb of white bread, meat, bruised
hemp seed, poppy and rape seed. When running about, the second universal
paste agrees very well with them. It is no doubt to assist their
digestion, that they often swallow fresh black earth, as I have always seen
those do that I have kept; this must not be forgotten to be given them, nor
water for them to bathe in, which they enjoy very much.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Breeding.</span>&mdash;This species breeds twice in the year, the first time in the
end of March, or the beginning of April. The nest, which is placed in a
hedge, bush, tuft of grass, or even in moss on the ground, is formed on the
outside of straws, interwoven and lined within with the hair of horses and
other animals. It contains from three to five eggs, of a dirty white, with
zig-zag lines and spots of brown. When reared from the nest the young
ones may be taught to imitate the song of the chaffinch, and a few notes of
other birds.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diseases.</span>&mdash;The disease most common to this bird is decline. The time
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>of moulting is very dangerous to them, as they suffer much, and sometimes
die; to render this period less dangerous, they should have fresh ants&#8217; eggs
as soon as it commences, a remedy most useful to this species, to chaffinches,
and to sparrows.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mode of Taking.</span>&mdash;The yellowhammer is easily taken in winter, near
our dwellings, either in a net, with a stalk of oats as a bait, or under a
basket or sieve, which may be thrown down, by drawing away the small
stick that supports it, by means of a string. They will also enter the area
or barn-floor trap, if a perching bird is fastened there, by a string attached
to the leather band round its body; in spring they may be caught like other
birds, by means of a bird-call.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attractive Qualities.</span>&mdash;The first of these is certainly the beauty of
the bird, but the fine yellow which sets it off fades gradually when kept in
the house, where it will live five or six years; the second is its song,
which, without being very distinguished, is rather pleasing; its call, though
not strong, is heard to some distance; but this bird, so gay, so spruce, so
active when free, becomes dull, idle, and awkward in a cage.</p></div>

<h4>THE CORN BUNTING.</h4>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;"><img src="images/i_134.png" alt="THE CORN BUNTING." title="" height="186" width="250" /></div>

<p class="center">Emberiza miliaria, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; Le Proyer, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Der Gerstenammer,
<span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> species, found throughout Europe and the north of
Asia, has not so good a title to be admitted into the house as
the preceding, not being distinguished either for its song or the
beauty of its colours. With a plumage very similar to that
of the sky-lark, it surpasses it in size, being seven inches and
a half in length, of which the tail measures three. The beak,
measuring six lines, is strong, yellowish on the under part in
summer; the rest of the year the whole of it is grey brown;
the feet the same, which stand six lines in height. The general
tint of the plumage is pale, reddish grey on the upper part of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
the body, and yellowish white on the under, speckled like the
lark&#8217;k, with blackish brown spots.</p>

<p>In the female the colours are rather lighter.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Habitation.</span>&mdash;In its wild state this bird is common in most parts of
Europe; in the more northerly parts it does not remain during the winter,
and only appears at certain seasons; in March they are met with amongst
the larks in the fields, meadows, and on the high roads, often perched on
the tops of willows, or on a stake in a hedge, on a milestone, or a clod of
earth.</p>

<p>In a room it may occupy a lark&#8217;s cage, but is more commonly let run
about at liberty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Food.</span>&mdash;Both at liberty and in confinement its food is similar to that of
the yellowhammer; it is however a more delicate bird.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Breeding.</span>&mdash;Its nest, placed under a bush, does not rest on the ground
but on the turf; it is constructed of the stalks of grass, and lined with horse-hair.
The eggs are grey, speckled with chestnut and streaked with black.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mode of Taking.</span>&mdash;In autumn these birds may be taken in an area
with a decoy bird; in winter, before the barn door, with bird-lime or a
clapper; in the spring with a bird-call.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attractive Qualities.</span>&mdash;Their song, shorter and less soft than that of
the yellowhammer, has only four or five notes; from their dwelling on the
<i>r</i> in the last, they have been given the name of <i>stocking weavers</i>.</p></div>

<h4>THE ORTOLAN.</h4>

<p class="center">Emberiza hortulena, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; L&#8217;Lrtolan, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Der Gartenammer,
<span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is necessary to give a very exact description of this species,
as not only bird-catchers, but even some naturalists, give
the name of Ortolan to several very different species. Under
this name the former sell all rare birds of this kind. The true
ortolan has a wider breast and stronger beak than the yellowhammer;
it is six inches and a half in length, of which the
tail measures two and a half; the beak, six inches long, is
thick at the base, with a bony tubercle at the palate, and is of
a yellowish flesh-colour; the iris dark brown. The legs, which
stand ten lines in height, are flesh-coloured; the head and
neck is greyish olive; the throat and a streak on the neck
from the angle of the beak, deep yellow.</p>

<p>The female is rather smaller, of a changeable shining ash-colour
on its head and neck, streaked with fine black lines.
Its breast, and the upper and under part of its body, are lighter
than in the male.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span></p>

<p>The throat of the young male birds, before the first moulting,
is of a light yellow, with a mixture of grey; the breast
and belly are of a reddish yellow, speckled with grey, which
make them rather resemble young yellowhammers. A bird
fancier will distinguish the two sexes even in the nest. There
are white, yellow, speckled, and in the house sometimes even
black varieties.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Habitation.</span>&mdash;In its wild state the ortolan is principally found in the
southern and temperate parts of Europe, and is not scarce in some of the
provinces of Germany; but if attention were paid to them there, they
might be seen in every direction on their passage; for though they may
not remain during the summer in a district, yet they make some stay,
never passing over a great space of country at a time. Their route is so
exact and regular, that when one has been seen in a particular spot, especially
if in spring, it is sure to be found there the following year at the
same time. They fly rather in families than flocks: the time of their arrival
in Germany is towards the end of April, or beginning of May; they
are then met with in orchards, amongst brambles or in groves, where they
build, particularly if millet is cultivated in the neighbourhood. During
harvest they frequent the fields in families, and leave after the oats are
gathered in<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">34</a>.</p>

<p>In the house, if much valued, they are given a cage; but in countries
where they are common they are let run about free.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Food.</span>&mdash;In their wild state they live on insects and grain. In the house
they are fed, if in a cage, on millet, hemp seed, and prepared oats; if at
liberty in a room the universal paste suits them very well. These birds,
being rather delicate, cannot often be preserved beyond three or four years.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diseases.</span>&mdash;The most common disease of these birds is atrophy, to cure
or prevent which it is necessary to know how properly to mix and vary
animal with vegetable food; but this calls for a greater degree of attention
and care than most persons are willing to give.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Manner of Taking.</span>&mdash;In spring these birds are easily attracted to a
decoy bush, by a female of their own species, or a yellowhammer. In
August a turfy place should be chosen near brambles, to form a small area,
as a decoy, like that made for chaffinches. It must be surrounded with a
low hedge, with some oat-ears fastened to it. About the area should be
placed one or several birds of call, especially a perching bird, that is to say,
a bird of the same species, with a band of soft leather round it, and confined
by a small string, fastened to a peg-stick in the ground, which prevents
its going beyond the prescribed limits. Here it should be given
plenty of food and water, in order that the birds to be caught may be the
more easily attracted within the area, from seeing one of their own species
in a place of abundance. This kind of decoy bird is often more necessary
than any other.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attractive Qualities.</span>&mdash;The fine form and colours of the ortolan
would be sufficient to render it desirable, but still more so its flute-like
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>warbling, so clear and full, which has some resemblance to that of the
yellowhammer, only that the last notes are much deeper.</p>

<p>Ever since ortolans have been known to epicures as a delicacy, they have
been fattened with great care. The common way is to keep them in a
room only lighted by lanterns, so that they cannot distinguish day from
night: they are then plentifully fed on oats, millet, and the crumb of
white bread, made up with good spice. In a short time they become so
fat that they would be suffocated if not killed at once. An ortolan thus
fed is a perfect ball of most delicious fat, weighing about three ounces.</p></div>

<h4>THE CIRL-BUNTING, <span class="smcap">Lath.</span></h4>

<p class="center">Emberiza Cirlus, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; Le Zizi, ou Bruant de Haie, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Der Zaunammer,
<span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span> has described only the female, and by mistake I
have called the male <i>Emberizal E&aelig;athorax</i>, and have given a
drawing of it and the female, in the second volume of my
German translation of the English work of Latham, Synopsis
of Birds, printed at Nuremberg, 1794.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Description.</span>&mdash;This bird, scarce in many provinces of Germany and in
Britain, but well known in Thuringia, is about the size of the yellowhammer,
being five inches and a half in length, of which the tail measures two
and a half. Its small and flattish beak is of a brownish blue on the upper
part, and light brown on the under; the feet, eight lines in height, are
flesh-coloured; the upper part of the head and neck olive green with small
black strokes, a golden yellow streak extends from the angle of the upper
mandible to the middle of the neck, passing under the eyes; another begins
from the angle of the under mandible, and descending in a straight line, is
crossed by a third, which is black, then curving round behind the yellow
streak under the eyes, reunites with the black one on the throat; the back
and smaller wing-coverts are cinnamon brown, mixed with black and yellow
green; the rump is olive, with black streaks; the breast is a fine olive
green, light chestnut on the sides; the rest of the under part of the body is
of a golden yellow.</p>

<p>The female is known by its plumage being much paler: the head and
upper part of the neck are olive, much streaked with black; the back is
pale brown, the rump more streaked with black, the tail rather greyish
black than black; two pale yellow lines pass one above the other below the
eyes, and cross a black line which unites to the black border of the cheeks;
the throat is brownish, with a lighter spot below; the breast is olive, with
the sides brownish, the rest of the under part of the body is pale yellow.</p>

<p>The young ones, before their first moulting, have the upper part of the
body light brown, speckled with black, the under pale yellow streaked with
black; the older they grow the more of an olive tint the breast acquires.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Habitation.</span>&mdash;In their wild state these birds dwell chiefly in the southern
and temperate parts of Europe, where they frequent orchards, groves,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>and the skirts of forests.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> They are birds of passage, which leave in November
and return in April; they are then met with very commonly
among the chaffinches.</p>

<p>In the house they must be treated in the same manner as the ortolan.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Food.</span>&mdash;In their wild state they feed on the cabbage caterpillar in summer,
and when corn is ripe, on wheat, barley, millet, oats, and other
grain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Breeding.</span>&mdash;They place their nest in a hedge or bush on the road side,
and build it of small straws and line it with horse-hair. The eggs are
greyish, speckled with chestnut. In the end of July, whole families are
met with in the fields, particularly those planted with cabbages, and that
have willows in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diseases and Mode of Taking.</span>&mdash;These are similar to what is said under
ortolan.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attractive Qualities.</span>&mdash;The male surpasses the ortolan in beauty, but
does not equal it in its song, as in this it more resembles the yellowhammer.</p>

<p>These birds, however, are very easily tamed, and may be preserved five
or six years.</p></div>

<h4>THE FOOLISH BUNTING.</h4>

<p class="center">Emberiza Cia, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; Le Bruant Fou, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Der Zipammer, <span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> bird is rather smaller than the yellowhammer, being
only six inches long, of which the tail measures two and a
half; the beak, five lines in length, is very sharp, blackish
above, and greyish below; the iris is dusky; the legs, nine
lines in height, are of a brownish flesh-colour. The head is
grey, spotted with red, with small black streaks on the top,
and an indistinct black line on the sides; the back is reddish
brown, speckled with black, the rump light red brown; the
throat pale ash-colour.</p>

<p>The female differs very little from the male: the head is grey
with a reddish tint and black spots; she has also all the streaks
that the male has, but less marked; the ash-coloured throat is
streaked with black and has a reddish tint; in short, the whole
of the under part of the body is lighter.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Habitation.</span>&mdash;When wild, this species, which loves solitude, and prefers
mountainous districts, inhabits the south of France, Italy, and the south of
Austria. In some winters they quit these countries and proceed even to
the middle of Germany, where they are found in March and April in
elevated situations.</p>

<p>In the house they are either kept in a cage or left to range a room, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>the latter seems to agree with them best, particularly if they have a grated
and quiet place to rest in and pass the night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Food.</span>&mdash;When wild, these birds, like others of the genus, feed on insects
and grain.</p>

<p>In the house they may be fed on the same food as the ortolan, on which
they may be preserved in health above six years, as I have proved by a pair
which I kept myself for that time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mode of taking.</span>&mdash;These birds come without difficulty at the call of
the yellowhammer, and enter into every kind of snare so heedlessly, that
they have thence been given the name of <i>foolish bunting</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attractive qualities.</span>&mdash;They are very fine and lively birds, whose
voice is heard the whole year; in winter their note of call, and from spring
to autumn, their cheerful song, shorter indeed, but clearer than that of the
yellowhammer. They live very amicably in a room with other species of
their genus, especially the yellowhammer; and where one goes the other
follows, and if one chooses any particular food, the other prefers the same.</p></div>

<h4>THE BLACK BONNET, OR REED BUNTING.</h4>

<span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> bird is nearly the size of the mountain sparrow, its
length being five inches three-quarters, of which the tail <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>measures
two and a half; the beak, four lines in length, is black
on the upper part, and whitish on the under; the iris is dark
brown; the legs, nine lines high, are dark flesh-coloured. The
head is black, with reddish spots; a reddish white line extends
from the base of the lower mandible quite round the head; the
back is black, spotted with white and red, the rump alternately
grey and reddish yellow; the throat is black spotted.</p>

<p>The feathers on the head of the male never return to as good
a black after moulting, when in the house, as in its wild state,
but remain always browner, and clouded with reddish white.</p>

<p>The head of the female is of a rusty brown, spotted with
black; her brown cheeks are encircled with a reddish white
streak, which, passing above the eyes, unites with another which
commences at the base of the beak; a dark streak passes down
the sides of the throat, which, with the under part of the body,
is reddish white, much streaked on the breast with light brown;
the colour of the back is lighter, but less clear than that of the
male.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Habitation.</span>&mdash;In their wild state this species is found throughout Europe
and the north of Asia, flying in small flocks, and returning in March in
great flights. The females follow the males, and do not remain behind, as
some pretend. During winter some of these birds are met with here and
there amongst the yellowhammers; they frequent moist places, the banks of
ponds and rivers; they run nimbly up the stalks of aquatic plants, but
rarely ascend trees.</p>

<p>In the house it is the custom here to let them range a room; but they
may be kept in a cage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Food.</span>&mdash;When wild they feed on the seeds of rushes, bullrushes, reeds,
and grasses, as well as on the numerous insects that frequent the water-side.</p>

<p>In the house they seem to relish the first universal paste and poppy seeds,
on which food they will live five or six years; but afterwards they droop
and die of atrophy or scurf, as I have remarked several times.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Breeding.</span>&mdash;These birds make their nests among the reeds and brambles
on the water-side. They lay five or six eggs of a dusky light grey, with
dark grey spots and dusky lines rather indistinctly mingled.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mode of Taking.</span>&mdash;In autumn they enter the area or decoy with the
chaffinch; in spring, when there is snow, they approach the barns and
dunghills, and there, as well as in open places in the fields and on the hedges,
they are very easily taken with a net or bird-lime.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attractive Qualities.</span>&mdash;Their song is alternately weak and strong.
Three or four simple tones, mingled from time to time with a sharp <i>r</i>,
distinguish it from every other; it is heard all the summer, even during the
night. Of all the buntings, this is the most easily tamed; it is also a
great amateur of music, approaching the instrument without fear, as I have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>observed several times, not of one only, but of many of these birds,
testifying its joy by extending its wings and tail like a fan, and shaking
them so that, by this exercise the feathers have been much injured.
The female sings also, but its tones are weaker than those of the male.</p></div>

<h4>THE SPARROW BUNTING.</h4>

<p class="center">Emberiza passerina, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; L&#8217;Lrtolan Passerin; Der Sperlingsammer,
<span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> species must have been confounded with the preceding,
or it would have been better known, as it is not rare either in
autumn or spring. It is smaller and more slender than the
former, being only five inches long, of which the tail measures
two and a quarter; the beak is black above and light brown
below; the iris is of a dark chestnut; the feet are nine lines in
height and of a dusky flesh-colour; but the plumage in general
is similar to that of the female of the preceding species.</p>

<p>The male has the top of the head red, with a grey longitudinal
streak in the middle, and many black spots arising from
the deeper shade of the feathers which appears in every direction;
a dusky reddish white line passes from the nostrils
above, and also a little under the eyes, and widening behind on
the temples, a chestnut brown colour breaks through a deep
black, which reaches the sides of the neck and becomes a spot
there.</p>

<p>The colours of the female are in general lighter, and the
black does not appear on the top of the head; a reddish white
streak passes above the eyes, another descends from the base of
the beak down the sides of the neck, a third, but of a dusky
black, extends from each side of the chin to beyond the middle
of the neck.</p>

<p>When kept in the house the black disappears from the head
of the male, and the upper part of the neck becomes greyish
white, spotted longitudinally with dusky black.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Observations.</span>&mdash;Thick woods and bushes in a mountainous country are
the favourite haunts of the sparrow bunting. It is a bird of passage, which
quits us in October or November and returns in April. It is not rare in
Thuringia, particularly at the time of passage; formerly it was only known
in Russia. Its food, when wild, is insects and all kinds of grain.</p>

<p>In the house, it is fed on the same food as the reed bunting, which it
very much resembles in its song and habits: it is taken in the same
manner.</p></div>

<h4>THE WHIDAH BUNTING.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> beautiful and rare species is the size of a linnet.
Reckoning from the beak to the end of the side tail-feathers,
it is five inches and a half in length. The beak is lead-coloured;
the iris chestnut; the feet are flesh-coloured; the
head, chin, front of the neck, back, wings, and tail are black;
the back of the neck pale orange; the breast, thighs, and upper
part of the belly are white, the lower part is black; the two
intermediate tail-feathers measure four inches, are very broad,
and terminate in a long filament; the two that follow, above
three inches long, are very broad in the middle, narrower and
pointed at the end, from their shaft springs also a filament
more than an inch long; the other side feathers are only two
inches and a half in length; the two in the middle amongst the
longest a little diverging, and arched like a cock&#8217;k, are glossy,
and more brilliant than the others.</p>

<p>The female is entirely brown, almost black, and does not acquire
its proper plumage until the third year; whilst young it
very much resembles the winter plumage of the male.</p>

<p>This bird moults twice in the year. At the first, which
takes place in November, the male loses its long tail for six
months, its head is streaked with black and white, the rest of
its plumage is a mixture of black and red; at the second,
which takes place late in the spring, it resumes its summer
dress, such as it has been described above, but the tail-feathers
do not attain their full length till July and drop in November.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Observations.</span>&mdash;This beautiful species comes from Angola, and other
parts of Africa, and is particularly common in the kingdom of Whidah, or
Juida, in Guinea, and hence it takes its name. Though it was formerly
brought in great numbers into Germany, it still costs there thirty or forty
rix dollars. These birds are very lively, and constantly in motion, always
waving their long tail up and down, often arranging their feathers and
amusing themselves with bathing. Their feeble song, though somewhat
melancholy, is however very agreeable. They may be preserved from
eight to twelve years if fed on canary seed, millet, barley meal, and the
like, not forgetting to add from time to time lettuce, endive, or other
green food. They must be given a large cage, to prevent their spoiling
their fine tail.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> species, six inches and three quarters in length, is
smaller, more rare, and nearly twice as dear as the preceding.
It comes from Africa likewise. The beak is red; the feet
grey; the upper part of the head is black, but the top is
reddish white, which extends over the whole of the under part
of the body, the chin, and temples, and even the under part of
the tail; sometimes this tint fades into pure white: the upper
part of the neck and the back are black, but the feathers are
edged with dusky white; the inner wing coverts being white,
give the wings the appearance of being so when folded, but
they are black, the quill-feathers alone are edged with white;
the tail is also black; the two middle feathers terminate in a
point, and are two inches longer than the others, which gradually
diminish in length the farther they are from the middle,
the three first only have the points white, but the two outer
ones have the beard white and the edge pale orange.</p>

<p>The female is entirely brown, and the tail-feathers are of
equal length. This species also moults twice in the year: the
male loses its tail for six months, and the white of its plumage
becomes less pure.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Observations.</span>&mdash;This bird requires the same treatment as the former,
and sings in the same very agreeable manner.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> is also more rare than the Whidah bunting. Its length
to the end of the short feathers of the tail is nearly four inches
and a half. The beak and feet are red; the upper part of the
body black; the sides of the head, the eyes, neck, and under
part of the body are orange.</p>

<p>The female is brown, and has no long feathers in the tail.
The winter plumage of the male is grey, like the linnet, but
rather brighter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> length of this bird is five inches. The beak dark lead-coloured;
the feet brown; the whole plumage is of the most
beautiful blue, deeper and still more brilliant at the top of the
head; the great quill-feathers are brown edged with blue; the
tail brown, with a pale tint.</p>

<p>The female very much resembles the linnet in its colour, as
the male does during moulting, for it is only blue when in full
feather; but the male may be distinguished easily at all times
by the sides of the wings being of a lighter grey than in the
female.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Observations.</span>&mdash;This species is most commonly found in Carolina, but
is not rare about New York, where it arrives the beginning of April. It
frequents the orchards when they are in bloom, and appears to prefer
mountainous parts. Its agreeable song, which very much resembles that
of the linnet, and the beauty of its plumage, render it a favourite with
bird-fanciers. Its food is canary seed, millet, poppy seed, and bruised
hemp seed.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> bird owes its name to its plumage. It is five inches
and a half in length, of which the tail measures two. The
beak is greyish brown, the iris nut brown; the feet brown;
the head and neck are violet, the circle round the eyes is red;
the upper part of the back and the scapulars are yellowish
green, the lower part, the rump, and all the under part of the
body are of a fine red; the lesser wing-coverts violet brown
with a red tinge, the greater of a dull green; the pen-feathers
brown, some bordered with grey, others with red; the tail-feathers
are also brown, but the two middle ones are of a
changeable red, and the outer border of the others is of the
same colour.</p>

<p>The upper part of the body of the female is of a dull green,
the under part yellow green; her pen-feathers are brown edged
with green, as are also the tail-feathers.</p>

<p>As the plumage of this bird does not come to perfection
before the third year, there must naturally be several varieties.
During the first year the male and female are of the
same colour; the head of the male does not become a violet
blue till the second year, and the rest of its plumage is then a
blue green, as are also the edges of the quill and tail-feathers,
which are elsewhere brown.</p>

<p>The female at this time is of a fine changeable blue. If to
these differences arising from age are added the two moultings
which take place every year, we shall not be surprised rarely
to meet with two birds alike. There is besides another variety,
having the under part of the body yellowish, except a red spot
on the breast; and again another, which in the time of moulting
is entirely white.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Observations.</span>&mdash;These birds are found from the frontiers of Canada to
Guiana and Brazil; none, however, are seen in Carolina less than one
hundred and thirty miles from the sea. They only show themselves in
summer, and build principally on orange or similar trees. English and
Dutch sailors take home many of these birds, and it has been said that in
England they have succeeded in making them breed in aviaries in gardens,
spacious enough to contain orange trees, on which they have constructed their
nests. When in a cage they are fed on millet, canary-seed, endive, and
poppy-seed, on which they may be preserved from eight to ten years. Their
song is soft and agreeable.</p></div>

<h4>THE CHAFFINCH.</h4>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;"><img src="images/i_146.png" alt="THE CHAFFINCH." title="" height="196" width="250" /></div>

<p class="center">Fringilla C&oelig;lebs, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; Le Pinson commun, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Der Buch-Fink,
<span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> delightful songster of spring, famed for the sprightliness
of its warbling,&mdash;this favourite of most of our bird-fanciers,
is so generally known that I should be tempted to suppress
its description if the uniformity of this work and the wish to
render it complete, did not impel me to give it. This will also
offer some particulars worthy the attention of the naturalist.</p>

<p>The passion for this bird is carried to such an extent in Thuringia,
and those which sing well are sought for with so much
activity that scarcely a single chaffinch that warbles tolerably
can be found throughout the province. As soon as one arrives
from a neighbouring country whose notes appear good, all the
bird-catchers are after it, and do not give up the pursuit till
they have taken it. This is the reason why the chaffinches in
this province are so indifferent songsters: the young ones have
only bad masters in the old ones, and they in their turn cannot
prove better.</p>

<p>This bird is six inches and one-third in length, of which the
tail measures two and three quarters. The beak is conical,
pointed, and white in winter; but as soon as spring, the season
of pairing and song, arrives, and till the time of moulting, it is
of a deep blue, and one may know by this whether it has sung
or not. The iris is chestnut brown; the legs, nine lines high,
are dusky; the claws are very sharp, and grow so fast in a
cage that it is necessary to cut them every six weeks, if you
do not wish to see the poor bird some day caught by them,
and perish miserably unless rescued. The forehead is black,
the top of the head and nape of the neck are greyish blue, in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
very old males deep blue, and then thick downy hairs are perceived.</p>

<p>After moulting, at the beginning of winter, the colours
become lighter, the front of the head is only deep brown; the
top and the nape of the neck a changeable greyish and olive
brown; the red brown of the breast is brighter; this is also
the plumage of the young ones in the second year, particularly
if of the last brood; they are called grey-heads, by bird-catchers,
who can easily distinguish, in the spring, the young
from the old males, and very much prefer them, because, if
properly caught, they may be taught to improve their song
when confined in the house; while the others never learn, or
change very little, at least rarely, the song they have acquired
in their wild state.</p>

<p>The female is very different, being smaller, while the head,
neck, and upper part of the back are greyish brown, and all
the under part of the body is a dusky white, rather reddish
grey on the breast; and the beak, greyish brown in spring,
becomes greyish white in winter.</p>

<p>There are some remarkable varieties of this species, one
quite white, another with a white collar, a third streaked,
spotted, &amp;c. There is no distinction between the wood
chaffinches and those of the gardens and orchards, as has been
alleged.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Habitation.</span>&mdash;In its wild state, the chaffinch frequents forests, copses,
and orchards, and ought to be reckoned among birds of passage, though
there are always some that remain the winter with us. The time of passage,
in autumn, continues from the beginning of October to the middle of
November, and in spring during the month of March. These birds perform
their journey in large flocks. In the spring the males arrive in separate
flights, fifteen days before the females; our bird-catchers know this so
well, that as soon as they perceive these they put up their implements,
their sport being then over.</p>

<p>In the house, though each may vary the form of the cage to his taste, the
best, in my opinion, is an oblong cage nine inches long, seven in depth, and
seven in height, with the food and water at the two farthest sides, and the
perches placed opposite. A bell-shaped cage does not suit the chaffinch, as
it prefers jumping down in front, and swinging itself round, to remaining at
the top. If there are several in one room they must be placed so as not to
see each other, or their song will be injured. Those only are allowed to
range whose song is very inferior, and must be provided with a grated place
to retire to, or some branches to perch on. These never sing so well as
those in cages, their song appearing to require the greatest attention, and
hence there should be nothing to distract them.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Food.</span>&mdash;When wild, their food in spring is all sorts of insects, which they
carry to their young in their beaks; later in the season they eat various
kinds of seeds, pine and fir seeds, when they inhabit forests that contain
them, linseed, oats, rape, cabbage, and lettuce, which they know well how
to procure and shell.</p>

<p>In the house they are fed all the year on rape seed, dried in summer, or,
which is better, soaked and swelled in water, on which food they appear to
thrive. Every day a sufficient quantity should be soaked for the next, and
given them fresh every morning. In the spring they are allowed a little
hemp-seed, or the seed of the nettle-hemp (<i>Galeopsis Tetrahit</i>), to
excite their song, and this plant is therefore very much prized in Thuringia;
but these seeds should not be mixed with the rape, as in trying to find
them they soon scatter their food; it is best to put it in a separate drawer
fastened to the iron wires of the cage, between which it may be slipped. It
must not be omitted to supply them with green vegetables, chickweed,
lettuce, and the like; and in winter a piece of apple, meal-worms, and ants'
eggs agree with them. They must have fresh water regularly every day,
both to drink and bathe in.</p>

<p>Those that range the room live on the different sorts of food they meet
with, bread, meat, and all sorts of seeds.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Breeding.</span>&mdash;The nest of the chaffinch is one of the most beautiful of
birds&#8217; nests, and formed in the most skilful manner. It is the shape of a
half globe flattened on the upper part, and so perfectly rounded that it has
the appearance of having been turned on a lathe. Cobwebs<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> and wool
fasten it to the branch, bits of moss with small twigs entwined form the
ground-work; the lining is composed of feathers, thistle-down, the hair of
horses and other animals, whilst the outer covering is formed of the different
lichens that grow on the tree in which it is placed, the whole firmly
united and well cemented. This outer finish is no doubt intended to
deceive an enemy&#8217;s eye; in fact, it is very difficult, even with great attention,
to distinguish the nest from the bark of the branch on which it is
fixed.</p>

<p>The female has two broods in the year; she lays from three to five eggs,
of a pale bluish grey, spotted and streaked with brown: the first brood
(and this is confirmed in general by observations of other birds) rarely
produces any but males, the second only females. Bird-fanciers can distinguish
the one from the other before they leave the nest; the breast of
the male already discovering a reddish tint, the circle round the eyes being
yellower, the wings blacker, and the lines that cross them whiter, though
in other respects it resembles its mother. If you wish to be quite sure,
pluck some feathers from the breast of the bird you have taken from the
nest, in a fortnight they will be replaced, and the presence or absence of
red will infallibly decide whether it is male or female. As soon as the tail-feathers
begin to appear they must be taken from the nest, to prevent the
possibility of their ear being injured by hearing an imperfect song, for
scarcely are the wings and tail half grown than these birds begin to warble,
and to imitate the song of those around them.</p>

<p>They must be fed on rape seed soaked in water and the crumb of white
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>bread; it is very easy to rear them and preserve them healthy till the time
of moulting, but then numbers perish, particularly if not quickly relieved
by being given meal-worms and ants&#8217; eggs, or any other animal food, as
bread boiled in or soaked in boiled milk.</p>

<p>Chaffinches that have been reared with care become very familiar, and
sing at command, or when one approaches their cage in a friendly manner.
If they are wished to learn quickly and accurately, they should be kept in
an obscure corner of the room, and only hung up at the windows in May;
this is the surest way to prevent their learning any thing imperfect. By
these means chaffinches that have been taken full grown have forgotten
their former song and adopted a better. The whole artifice consists in
keeping the bird in such retirement as will remove everything that might
distract it when listening to a fine songster, and take away the wish to sing
itself.</p>

<p>There have been examples of chaffinches pairing with female canaries,
and it has been said with a female yellowhammer. The distinction between
wood and garden chaffinches is unfounded, at least as to species; the eggs
of both are of the same whitish pink colour.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diseases.</span>&mdash;The disorders to which the chaffinch is most subject are the
obstruction of the rump gland<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> and diarrh&oelig;a. To cure this an old nail or
a little saffron should be put in the water.</p>

<p>When the scales on the feet become too large, the upper ones must be
cut skilfully with a sharp knife, or else the bird would either lose the use
of his limbs or become gouty; but this operation must be performed with
great care.</p>

<p>Blindness also is not uncommon, particularly where they are fed much
on hemp seed. This does not, however, injure their song, and as it comes
on gradually, it does not prevent their finding their food and hopping about
the perches. By means of proper care a chaffinch may be preserved twenty
years.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mode of Taking.</span>&mdash;With good baits the chaffinch may easily be drawn
within the area or decoy from Michaelmas to Martinmas, and in spring
throughout March. Those that remain the winter, or return early in the
year, may be taken in a net baited with oats.</p>

<p>bird-catchers use in spring lures and lime twigs, and the sport lasts as
long as the time of flight, which begins at daybreak and ends at nine o&#8217;olock.
These birds employ the rest of the day in seeking food in the fields, in
resting, and singing. In the same manner are taken linnets, goldfinches,
siskins, yellowhammers, and bullfinches.</p>

<p>Some make use of the excessive jealousy of the males to procure those
whose song is very superior. As soon as a bird-catcher who likes this way
discovers a fine songster wild, he immediately seeks another male that is
in the habit of often repeating its natural cry, <i>fink, fink</i>, ties his wings, and
fastens to his tail a little forked stick, half a finger long, well covered with
bird-lime; thus prepared, he fastens him under the tree on which the one
he is watching is perched; this no sooner sees and hears the false rival
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>than he becomes enraged, pounces on him like a bird of prey, and is caught
with the bird-lime; his attack is often so violent that sometimes the bird
of call is killed by the stroke of its adversary. The following is a surer
method:&mdash;a soft, narrow leather band is fastened round a male, to which
is attached a string a foot long, fastened by a peg, which allows it but a
short space to range. This bird, as we have already said, is called, in
bird-catchers&#8217; language, a percher. A circle of bird-lime is made just beyond
its reach, and a cage with a chaffinch, accustomed to sing either in the shade
or exposed, is placed under a neighbouring bush; as soon as this last
begins his song, which should be a natural one, not any learned in confinement,
the chaffinch that is to be procured darts from the tree like an
arrow on the percher, which it mistakes for the songster, and remains fixed
by the bird-lime. This new prisoner will sing the same year if it is caught
before Whitsuntide: if after, it will never sing, but will die, evidently from
grief at being separated from its female and young ones. A bird-catcher,
cruel as he is stupid, who, without the least reflection, only thinks of gratifying
his ridiculous passion for bird-catching, may in an hour deprive ten or
twelve females of their beloved companions, their protectors, and numerous
young ones of their father, purveyor, and support: such thoughtless cruelty
is, alas! only too common in Germany. As soon as the young chaffinches
have left the nest, the bird-catchers are very active in discovering the places
where at noon they are accustomed to drink; there they set perches covered
with bird-lime, and by this means many of these little unwary creatures are
taken. However little memory one of these birds may have, it is capable
of learning a good song, and being more robust than those brought up from
the nest, bird-dealers make a good deal of them. They collect a great
many, being sure that some will succeed amongst them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attractive Qualities.</span>&mdash;The first of these is undoubtedly the song of the
bird; but our amateurs are not less attentive to the different notes that
express its passions and wants. The note of tenderness, and which is also
thought to indicate a change of weather, is <i>trif, trif</i>: its call, or the rallying
note it makes use of on its passage, and which so often draws it within
the snares of our bird-catchers, is <i>&iuml;ak, &iuml;ak</i>, repeated several times; the cry
<i>fink, fink</i>, which it often repeats, and from which its German name is
derived, appears, if we may so call it, to be mechanical and involuntary.
But what makes it appear to still more advantage among other birds are its
clear and trilling tones, that seem almost to approach to words; in fact, its
warbling is less a song than a kind of <i>battement</i>, to make use of a French
word, and is expressed in German by the word <i>schlag</i> (trill), which is used
to designate its song as well as the nightingale&#8217;e. Some chaffinches have
two, three, four, and even five different <i>battemens</i>, each consisting of several
strains, and lasting several minutes. This bird is so great a favourite
in Germany, that not a single tone of its voice has escaped the experienced
ears of our bird-fanciers. They have observed its nicest shades, and are
continually endeavouring to improve and perfect it. I confess I am myself
one of its warmest admirers; I have constantly around me the best songsters
of its species, and if I liked I could write a good sized volume on all
the details of its music, but I will confine myself to that which bears most
on this subject.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span></p>

<p>The song of the chaffinch bearing an evident relation to articulate sounds,
its has been thought to distinguish its different variations by the final syllable
of the last strain. The most admired in Thuringia are the following,
which I shall give in their order, and in their different degrees of superiority.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">38</a></p>

<p>1. <i>The Double Trill of the Hartz</i> in Lower Saxony is composed of six
strains, rather long, the last of which is ended by dwelling on the two final
syllables, which I shall express here by the word &#8220;<i>weingeh</i><a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">39</a>.&#8221; I doubt
if ever a bird in its wild state has executed this so perfectly as I heard it
at Ruhl<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">40</a> and at my own house. Art has certainly created it. It is with
difficulty that a chaffinch attains it, if, with the best abilities, it has not
been instructed from its earliest youth. Rarely can it give it complete
without leaving any part out. On this account a high price must be given
for the little prodigy that sings it through, full, entire, and in all its strength.</p>

<p>2. <i>The Reiterzong</i>, or rider&#8217;s pull, first heard among the mineral
mountains of Saxony and Voigtland, has been known but a short time in
Thuringia. It may be heard from a chaffinch in its wild state, but those
that have been instructed execute it in a fuller, stronger, and less precipitate
manner. This song consists of four strains, the first of which commences
in a high key, and gradually descends. When in perfection there
is a cadenced pause before the two last syllables, which articulate tolerably
clearly <i>reitzing</i> with a <i>zap</i> or clapping, as our amateurs express it. An
amateur who has never heard the double trill of the Hartz would not
believe that a chaffinch could sing in a superior manner to this; however,
in this, as in many other things, each has his taste.</p>

<p>3. <i>The Wine Song</i> is divided into four kinds, 1. the fine, or L&auml;ngsfeld
wine song<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">41</a>, is very beautiful, but little known except in two or three
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>places in Thuringia. It is composed of four strains, and to be perfect
ought to resemble a hautboy, the two last syllables articulating &#8220;<i>weingeh</i>.&#8221;
This song has never been heard from a wild chaffinch, but is one accidentally
produced in the house, and endeavoured to be propagated by education.</p>

<p>2. The bad wine song is not in itself disagreeable, but it is so named when
compared with the former. It is composed of three strains, of which the
penultimate ought to sound <i>zap</i> five times, and the two last syllables articulate
&#8220;<i>weingeh</i>.&#8221; When once a wild chaffinch has been heard to utter
this in Germany it is not long ere it is caught. 3. The sharp wine song is not
ended by &#8220;<i>weingeh</i>,&#8221; but &#8220;<i>weingieh</i>.&#8221; It is subdivided into the common
sharp, such as is sometimes heard in the woods, and the Ruhl sharp,
which is an entirely artificial song, confined to Ruhl and a few other villages
of Thuringia. It has but two strains, of which the first syllables
ought to sound as though flowing into each other, and the penultimate to
have an accent.</p>

<p>4. <i>The Br&auml;utigam</i>, or bridegroom song, is also divided into good and
bad: the good is only heard in the house, and consists of two simple strains;
it begins <i>piano</i>, afterwards <i>forte</i>, and, continuing <i>crescendo</i>, ends in the
most brilliant sound. After the double trill of the Hartz it appears to my
ear the finest of all. The bad is occasionally heard in the woods, and is
composed of three strains; but though not devoid of sweetness, does not
please so much as the former.</p>

<p>5. <i>The Double Trill</i> is formed of two long strains, divided by a
cadenced pause, which is named the shake. They distinguish, 1. the
common, subdivided into four; <i>a</i>, the strong, <i>b</i>, the clear, <i>c</i>, the long,
and <i>d</i>, the short. These are heard sometimes in the woods and
orchards; but chaffinches that sing <i>a</i> or <i>b</i> soon become the prey of our
bird-catchers. 2. The double trill of Iambach<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">42</a>; this is only to be acquired
in the house, and is so deep and powerful that one can scarcely
conceive how the larynx of so small a bird can produce such sounds. It
begins <i>piano</i>, and swelling its tones successively in <i>crescendo</i>, makes of the
<i>trilling</i> a strain of five piercing tones, afterwards repeats &#8220;<i>pfaff</i>&#8221; four or
five times, and ends by dwelling on &#8220;<i>R&uuml;didia</i>.&#8221; A chaffinch that possesses
this song, either alone, or united with the good bridegroom&#8217;s song,
such as are educated in Iambach, sells here for eighteen French francs.</p>

<p>6. <i>The Gutjahr</i>, or good year song, is so named from the two last
syllables, and is also divided, 1. into the common, that has but two strains,
of which the second ought to roll five times before articulating &#8220;<i>gutjahr</i>.&#8221;
It is not uncommon in our woods. 2. The good year of the Hartz, which has
been acquired in the house, and consists of two very singular strains, in
my opinion not very agreeable. Chaffinches are very rare now which sing
this, united to that of the wine song of Ruhl, or the sharp song, and their
price is consequently high. They are rarely found but at Ersenach and
Ruhl.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span></p>

<p>7. <i>The Quakia song</i> is so called from its last syllables, and is double
or single, one with one strain, the other with two. This song was formerly
very much admired. It was heard in the woods and house, but it is
now lost, as all the wild chaffinches that sung it have been taken, and those
in confinement have been taught in preference the good wine song: I
believe I possess the only bird that is now to be found which sings this.
To be admired, the quakia must be united with the double trill. This
my chaffinch sings also.</p>

<p>8. <i>The Pithia</i> or <i>Trewethia</i>, is a very uncommon and agreeable song,
which is never heard but in the depths of the Thuringian mountains.
The bird-catchers of the villages about the forests of Hesse seek for birds
that possess it, and actively pursue the songsters. It is first a sonorous
strain, followed by several repetitions of the word &#8220;<i>zack</i>.&#8221; Some birds
unite to it the common sharp wine song, and are more valued. The last
syllables ought to sound &#8220;<i>trewidid&aelig;</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>These eight varieties, or rather melodies, are those most thought of in
Saxony and Hesse. I have said that some of them are heard in the woods;
but it is very rarely that they are sung with so clear and strong a voice, or
that they are so long and perfect. A chaffinch that knows only one of
these varieties generally sings it slowly, and introduces a greater number of
syllables. Its voice, in fact, executes it with more strength and depth; if
it adds to the last strain the sound &#8220;<i>fink</i>,&#8221; which our bird-catchers translate
by <i>amen</i>, it is of the highest value, no price will be taken for it.</p>

<p>There are a dozen varieties in all; but as they are not uncommon, and
what are everywhere heard, they are less admired; they have even been given
in contempt the name of <i>plain</i>.</p>

<p>One thing worth remarking is that the song of the chaffinch varies almost
as much as the countries it inhabits. It is not the same in Thuringia as
in the Hartz, and the taste of amateurs differs equally<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">43</a>. In Austria several
named melodies are admired, but I have never heard them.</p>

<p>The chaffinch has so great a facility in learning, that it not only imitates
perfectly the song of another chaffinch near which it has been placed from
youth, but being hung near a nightingale or canary it learns several parts of
their songs, and would no doubt give them completely if its larynx were so
formed that it could render notes so long and sustained; in fine, a great
difference in memory is observed in these birds, as well as in all others of
the singing species. Some require six months to learn an air that others
catch on first hearing, and can repeat almost immediately; these can
scarcely retain one of the songs given above; those can imitate three,
four, and, should you wish it, five different ones. There are also some that
cannot give one song without a fault, and we find others that will add to it,
perfect it, and embellish it.</p>

<p>One thing peculiar to chaffinches is the necessity of teaching them their
song every year, and this in the manner proper for them, during the four or
five weeks this exercise lasts. They first utter a murmur, or weak warbling,
to which they add at first, in an under voice, one or two, and afterwards
several syllables of their song; they are then said to <i>record</i>. A
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>chaffinch that takes only a week or fortnight to repeat this lesson for fully
bringing out its voice, is reckoned among the geniuses of its species. It is
known that other birds whose power of singing is confined to a particular
season, also warble feebly, and mingle with their warbling some foreign
notes, especially harsh and confused sounds; but none produce sounds so
peculiar, and that have so little relation to their own song. If we pay a
little attention, however, we shall find that this exercise is intended less to
awaken the memory than to render the throat, stiffened by a tolerably
long state of inaction, more pliant, and to bring back its natural flexibility.</p>

<p>Wild chaffinches, on their return in spring, do not delay to record; those
in the house soon learn, but they are obliged to exercise themselves for
nearly two months before they can execute their song to perfection. The
singing season does not generally extend beyond June, but young chaffinches
brought up in a room prolong it to October, and sometimes later.</p>

<p>Some amateurs of the song, rather than friends of the bird, to procure
the pleasure of hearing it night and day in all its strength, employ a very
cruel and inhuman contrivance. They first place the cage in a very obscure
place, and accustom the poor little creature to find its food in the dark;
they then blind it, either by destroying the pupils of the eyes with a red
hot iron wire, or by passing it over the edges of the eyelids, unite and
paste them completely together.</p>

<p>Others shut up these poor mutilated creatures in a cool place, almost
without air, during the summer, in order that when in autumn they are
brought to the window, and breathe the fresh air, they may express their
joy by their lively and repeated song. What can we think of the heart
and morals of people who for a slight amusement thus enjoy the sufferings
of a sensitive being that is unfortunately in their power?</p></div>

<h4>THE MOUNTAIN FINCH.</h4>

<p class="center">Fringilla montifringilla, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; Le Pinson d&#8217;drdenne, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Der Bergfink,
<span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> bird is six inches and a quarter in length, of which the
tail measures two and a half and the beak half an inch; this is
yellow, with a black tip. The feet, nine lines high, are dark
flesh-coloured; all the feathers of the head and cheeks are
black with reddish edges, wider and more distinct in young
males, and becoming fainter from age, almost disappear in old
ones, whose heads become quite black; the tail rather forked,
and black.</p>

<p>The colours of the female are more uniform; she is brown
where the male is black, and only a rusty colour where he
is red.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span></p>

<p>Independently of the varieties produced by age, and which
are tolerably numerous, without being very remarkable, there
are some more remarked, such as those with a white head, a
back quite white, &amp;c.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Habitation.</span>&mdash;In their wild state this species is scattered throughout
Europe; however, it is most probable that in the summer they only
inhabit the northern parts. During the three other seasons they are found
everywhere in Germany, particularly where there are large forests. When
beech-mast is plentiful in Thuringia the mountain finches assemble in
immense numbers, it is supposed more than 100,000.</p>

<p>In the house they are kept in a cage or not, according as they are
esteemed; where they are common they are not thought worthy of one,
but allowed to range at will.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Food.</span>&mdash;Wild, and in confinement, it is the same as the chaffinch&#8217;h.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mode of Taking.</span>&mdash;This bird&#8217;s note of call is <i>&iuml;ak, &iuml;ak, qu&auml;&auml;k</i>, and as
the two first sounds are the same as that of the chaffinch, they will come
at its call, and fly in its company. They also afford the best sport with a
net, for in autumn hundreds may be taken at one cast. In winter they are
caught near barns under nets, or even under common sieves; and in spring
on a decoy bush, at the call of the chaffinch, if one of its own species cannot
be procured.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attractive Qualities.</span>&mdash;We cannot boast of sweetness in the song of
this bird, as it consists of low whistling, or a kind of warbling, intermixed
at intervals with a shrill &#8220;<i>raitch</i>,&#8221; the whole somewhat resembling the
first exercises of the chaffinch; but this wretched warbling may be improved
by education. A mountain finch placed by the side of a chaffinch
that sung well, learnt to imitate it tolerably, but I must confess that it
never attained great perfection. I should warn bird-fanciers who wish to
keep these birds for the beauty of their plumage, not to let them range with
many companions, for they are quarrelsome, and very lavish in distributing
severe pecks, especially if food is not very abundant. In Thuringia they
are kept in cages to be employed as lures in the area or decoy enclosure.
It is said that it is easier to teach them to go and come than the chaffinch.</p></div>

<h4>THE HOUSE SPARROW.</h4>

<p class="center">Passer domestica, <span class="smcap">Ray</span>; Le Moineau franc, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Der Haussperling,
<span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Though</span> this and the following species cannot be reckoned
among those that are pleasant in a room, yet I must not omit
them on account of their being easily preserved, and though
distinguished neither for their song nor their colours, yet they
make up for the want of these by agreeable qualities, that many,
much more admired, do not possess.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span></p>

<p>It is almost superfluous to describe a species so well known.
The total length is five inches and three quarters; the beak
thick and blue black; the feet greyish brown; the top of the
head and cheeks greyish ash-coloured with a broad chestnut
streak behind the eyes, elsewhere surrounded with black.</p>

<p>The female differs a good deal, the upper part of the body
being greyish red, spotted with black on the back, and the
under part of a dusky greyish white.</p>

<p>The young males before their first moulting very much
resemble their mothers.</p>

<p>The varieties known here are the white, the yellow, the
tawny, the black, the blue, the ash-coloured, and the streaked.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Habitation.</span>&mdash;In its wild state, it haunts the vicinity of houses; when
confined, it is allowed to range the room.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Food.</span>&mdash;If, unfortunately, it is too true that the sparrows cause great
injury in ripe fields of wheat, barley, and peas, it must be acknowledged
that they are very useful in our orchards and gardens, by destroying, in the
spring, thousands of insects, on which they feed their young ones as well as
themselves<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">44</a>. In the house, they feed on any kind of food: oats, hemp
seed, or rape seed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Breeding.</span>&mdash;Small openings under the tiles, crevices in walls, empty
martin&#8217;s nests, are the places they appropriate for breeding, and they line
their nest thickly with feathers. The female has two or three broods every
season, and has from five to seven young ones at a time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mode of Taking.</span>&mdash;Sparrows are so cunning that it is difficult to attract
them within the net or on lime twigs. They may be caught in numbers
however on the brambles in a field where sheep are kept, by sticking plenty
of bird-lime about them. They may be taken also by placing a net before those
that have retired to cherry trees and under the tiles to sleep for the night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attractive Qualities.</span>&mdash;The bird-fancier who enjoys seeing several
birds running about the room, will, with pleasure, admit the sparrow among
them, and may amuse himself especially by observing it breed and produce
mules with the hen tree-sparrow. A jar or cup placed in a corner will
serve as their nuptial bed. A male tree-sparrow with a hen sparrow does
not succeed.</p>

<p>The sparrow may be easily taught to go and come at command, by choosing
winter as the time to effect it. It is necessary first to keep it a month
near the window in a large cage supplied with the best food, such as millet,
meal, or white bread soaked in milk. It will even go there to deposit its
eggs if a small box is placed in the cage, with an opening for it to enter
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>at. Finally, no bird becomes more familiar, or testifies more attachment
to its master. Its actions are very lively, confiding, and delicate. A
soldier, says Buffon, had a sparrow which followed him every where, and
knew him in the midst of the regiment.</p></div>

<h4>THE TREE SPARROW, <span class="smcap">Lath</span>.</h4>

<p class="center">Passer montana, <span class="smcap">Ray</span>; Friquet, ou Moineau des haies, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Der Feldsperling,
<span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> species is more beautiful than the preceding. In length
it is five inches and a half; the beak is dusky; the feet are
bluish flesh-coloured; the upper part of the head as far as the
nape of the neck is reddish brown; the cheeks are white with
a black spot; a white ring surrounds the neck; the back is
spotted with black and red; the lower part of the back and
the rump are grey brown; the throat white, the breast light
ash-coloured; the belly dusky white; the quill feathers and
tail are dark brown; the lesser wing-coverts rust-red; the
greater, black with red edges and white tips, which form two
transverse bars.</p>

<p>Two varieties are known, the white and streaked.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Habitation.</span>&mdash;In their wild state, they are not only found throughout
Europe, but also in the north of Asia and America. In Germany and
England it is not so common as the house sparrow, for in some provinces
it is never seen. It frequents gardens, orchards, and fields abounding with
trees and hedges. In September, large flights are seen to fall upon the ripe
fields of barley and oats.</p>

<p>In the house it is let run about like the former, which it does very
awkwardly from having short legs, and this gives it the appearance of dragging
along on its belly. It is only kept in a cage in countries where it is
very rare.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Food.</span>&mdash;This is the same as that of the preceding.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Breeding.</span>&mdash;The nest must be sought in the holes of fruit trees, or in
hollow willows at the water&#8217;s edge; it breeds twice in the year.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mode of Taking.</span>&mdash;This is the same as the preceding; but being less
distrustful and cunning, it is easily enticed under a sieve placed before a
barn in winter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attractive Qualities.</span>&mdash;Its plumage is prettier than the preceding, its
song is also less short and monotonous; but it is weak, and when it might
be sweet, it is lost among the other songs in the room. The tree sparrow
might be accustomed in the country to go and come at command by treating
it in the manner described with respect to the house sparrow. It is
more difficult to preserve it, and it generally dies of decline.</p></div>

<h4>THE COMMON LINNET.</h4>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;"><img src="images/i_158.png" alt="THE COMMON LINNET." title="" height="288" width="350" /></div>

<p class="center">Fringilla cannabina, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; La Linotte, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Der Lanning, <span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> length of this well-known bird is more than five inches,
of which the tail measures two inches and a half. The beak,
six lines long, is dusky blue in summer, and in winter greyish
white, with the point brown; the iris dark brown; the feet,
eight lines high, are black. There are some very striking
varieties produced by the season and age in the plumage of the
male, which are not observed in the female, and these have
caused great confusion in works on birds, so much, that bird-catchers
are still persuaded these birds, in a different dress, are
distinct species.</p>

<p>Instructed by long experience and the observations of many
years, I hope to show in my description that our common
linnet (<i>Fringilla Linota</i>, Linn&aelig;us), the greater redpole (<i>Fringilla
cannabina</i>, Linn&aelig;us), and, according to all appearance, the
mountain linnet (<i>Fringilla montana</i>, Linn&aelig;us), are one and the
same species. A male three years old or less, is distinguished
in spring by the following colours, and by the name of redpole.
The forehead is blood red, the rest of the head reddish ash<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>coloured,
the top rather spotted with black; the cheek, sides of
the neck, and the circle round the eyes, have a reddish white
tint; the feathers of the back are chestnut with the edges
lighter; the upper tail-coverts are black edged with reddish
white; the throat and under part of the neck are yellowish
white, with some dashes of reddish grey; the sides of the breast
are blood red edged with reddish white, the sides of the belly
are pale rust-coloured; the rest of the under part of the body
is reddish white; the greater wing coverts are black, bordered
with reddish white, the others are rusty brown with a lighter
border. The quill-feathers are black tipped with white, the
first are edged with white nearly to the point, the narrow
beard forms a parallel white streak to the quill-feathers; the
tail is black and forked, the four outer feathers on both sides
have a broad white border, that of the two middle feathers is
narrower, and reddish white.</p>

<p>After moulting, in autumn, little red is seen on the forehead,
because the feathers become coloured from the bottom to the
top; the breast has not yet acquired its red tint, for the white
border is still too wide; but when winter comes its colours
appear.</p>

<p>Males one year old have no red on the head, and more
dashes of black; the breast is pale red waved with pale and
dark, the under part of the feathers on the breast is only a
bright reddish grey brown, the edges of these feathers are of a
reddish white; the back rust-colour has some detached spots of
dark brown and reddish white. These birds are known under
the name of grey linnets.</p>

<p>After the second moulting, if the reddish grey feathers are
blown aside, blood red specks may be discovered on the forehead,
and the red of the breast is only hidden by the wide
yellowish white borders to the feathers; these are the yellow
linnets, or the rock linnets, as they are called in Thuringia.</p>

<p>I have myself taken linnets whose foreheads and breasts
have been bright reddish yellow instead of blood red, a colour,
in fact, that sometimes, in the house, becomes blood red.
Bird-catchers give these also the name of yellow linnets. It
is a deterioration of the red caused by illness during moulting,
or by old age, and they are not wrong in regarding them as the
best and the finest singers. I have taken several, but on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
account of their scarcity, I have always kept them for myself.
Their song was very fine and clear, but they cannot be tamed,
and have generally died soon of sorrow and melancholy, from
which I conclude that they were very old.</p>

<p>Besides these three different varieties of plumage of the
males, there are several clouded, produced by the seasons and
old age; for instance, the older they become, the redder the
head is. I have in my cabinet all the gradations of this
change. Birds brought up in the house never acquire the fine
red on the forehead and breast, but remain grey like the males
of one year old; on the other hand, old ones, red when brought
into the house, lose their beautiful colours at the first moulting,
and remaining grey like the young ones, are no more than
grey linnets.</p>

<p>This difference of colour does not take place in the females,
which are smaller than the males; the upper part of the body
is grey streaked with dusky brown and yellowish white, on
the rump with greyish brown and reddish white; these spots
are more numerous on the breast; the wing-coverts are a
dusky chestnut. The females are distinguished in the nest by
the back being more grey than brown, and by the number of
streaks on the breast, which resembles that of the lark; bird-fanciers
leave these in the nest and take only the males.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Habitation.</span>&mdash;In its wild state the linnets are spread throughout Europe.
In the summer they frequent the skirts of large forests, thickets,
hedges, and bushes, particularly furze; but as soon as September arrives,
they pass in large flights to the fields. They are wandering birds, that in
winter go hither and thither seeking food in places free from snow, but in
March they return to their native places.</p>

<p>In confinement it is best to keep them in square cages, as they are less
subject to giddiness in these than in round ones, and sing better. They are
not often allowed to range the room, as they are very indolent, remaining
immoveable in the same place, and running the risk of being trodden on;
but if a small tree or a roost be placed in a corner, they may be let out of
the cage with safety, as they will remain perched there, only leaving it to
eat or drink, and will sing all day long.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Food.</span>&mdash;When wild, their food is all kinds of seeds that they can shell,
and these remain in the crop some time to be moistened before passing
into the stomach. In the house, it is only summer rape seed,<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">45</a> which
need not be soaked in water for them, as for the chaffinch, since, having a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>much stronger crop and stomach, they can digest much better. It is not
necessary always to give them hemp seed with it, and they must not be
fed abundantly, for taking little exercise, they easily become fat, and sometimes
die from this cause; but a little salt mixed with their food is useful,
as it preserves them from many diseases, and they like it. When linnets
are allowed to run about, they will feed with the other birds on the common
universal paste; but they must be given green vegetables, water, and
sand, as they are very fond of bathing and dusting themselves.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Breeding.</span>&mdash;Linnets have two broods in the year. They lay from four
to six eggs for each, of a bluish white, speckled with reddish brown, especially
at the large end. Their nest placed in a hedge, a white or black-thorn,
or, if in a country where they are common, on a vine, or a furze
bush, is composed of small twigs, dried grass and moss, and lined with
wool, the hair of horses, and other animals. The parent birds feed their
young ones from their beaks, and do not discontinue it if prisoners in the
same cage. If the young ones are to be taught a new song, they must be
taken from the nest when the shafts of the feathers are just appearing, that
they may have no idea of their parents&#8217; song. The males may be easily
distinguished by their white collar, and from having the most white about
the wings and tail.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diseases.</span>&mdash;The most common disorders of this species are constipation,
atrophy, and epilepsy. A linnet, however, will, in general, live from ten
to twelve years in the house.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mode of Taking.</span>&mdash;These birds are distrustful and suspicious, and,
notwithstanding decoys and perching birds, it is very difficult to entice
them within the decoy or area, and never many together. In the spring,
by means of a good decoy-bird, a few may be taken on a decoy-bush. In
the autumn, by fastening snares or lime twigs to the stalks of lettuces, of
the seeds of which the linnets are very fond, several may be taken. Our
shepherds turn and support the cribs, used to feed the sheep from, in such
a manner, that the linnets, coming to gather the grains of salt, easily overturn
them on themselves. The call of the linnet is &#8220;<i>g&auml;cker</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attractive Qualities.</span>&mdash;The agreeable, brilliant, and flute-like song of
the linnet, consists of several strains, succeeding each other very harmoniously.
Our amateurs consider its beauty to depend on there being often
mingled with it some acute and sonorous tones, that a little resemble the
crowing of a cock, and have made people say that this bird <i>crows</i>. Its
song is only interrupted during the year by moulting. A young one taken
from the nest, which may be easily brought up on a mixture of the wetted
crumb of white bread, soaked rape seed, and eggs boiled hard, not only
learns the songs of different birds that it hears in the room, such as nightingales,
larks, and chaffinches, but if kept by itself, airs and melodies that
are whistled to it, and will even learn to repeat some words. Of all house
birds, this, from the softness and flute-like sound of its voice, gives the airs
that it is taught in the neatest and most agreeable manner. It is also one
of those that pay best; some here cost from three to five rix-dollars when
they can warble an air preceded and followed by a grand flourish as of
trumpets. The weavers and shoemakers often bring up many of these
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>birds. It is very pleasing and surprising to hear a young linnet that is well
taught by a nightingale. I have one, whose imitations are as perfect as
possible. It amuses me throughout the year, but especially when my nightingales
are silent.</p>

<p>Linnets may be accustomed to go and come at command, by treating
them in their youth, or in the winter, as I have directed for the house-sparrow;
but as they are more timid, it is necessary to be more careful.</p>

<p>It is common for a male linnet to pair with a hen canary, and their progeny
can scarcely be distinguished from the grey canary. They sing delightfully,
and learn different airs with great facility.</p>

<p>It is well known, that among linnets, some are finer warblers than
others, and that, as with many other birds, the old ones sing better than
the young; on which account, yellow linnets, being the oldest, are the
most valued.</p></div>

<h4>THE LESSER REDPOLE.</h4>

<p class="center">Fringilla Linaria, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; Le Sizerin, ou Petite Linotte des Vignes, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>;
Der Flachsfink, <span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> its plumage this bird resembles the linnet; but in its
actions and shape it more resembles the siskin. It is five inches
and one quarter in length, of which the tail measures two and
one quarter; the beak, four lines long, is very sharp and yellow;
its shanks, eight lines high, are black; the top of the
head is a brilliant crimson; the upper part of the body is dark
brown, spotted with white and rust yellow; the rump is rose-coloured;
the throat black; the feathers on the under part of
the neck and breast are bright rose-coloured, edged with white;
the rest of the under part is white. The plumage of the female
is lighter; the breast is not rose-coloured, except that
when very old it acquires a slight tint, as well as the rump;
the upper part of the body is spotted with white and deep
brown, and the breast is rather speckled with the same colours.
The latter characteristics serve to distinguish the females from
young males, that also are without the rose-colour on the
breast, but have the rust-coloured and dark brown back of the
older birds. The males, confined to the house, lose, at the
first moulting, the fine rose-coloured breast, and, at the second,
the crimson of the head, which generally changes to a greenish
yellow. I have a male bird, the top of whose head became, at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
the third moulting, of a fine golden yellow, and has retained
its brilliancy for six years.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Habitation.</span>&mdash;In its wild state the lesser redpole is found in every part
of Europe; yet we must consider the north as its native home, Scotland,
Sweden, Lapland, Norway, and Greenland. Great flights arrive amongst us
at the end of October, and leave us in March and April. In winter, they
frequent places planted with alders, the seeds of which they appear very
fond of. They are principally found in company with siskins.</p>

<p>In the house, it shows off its beautiful plumage, which, alas! does not
retain that beauty long, it is often placed in a pretty cage, but most commonly
allowed to range through a room.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Food.</span>&mdash;When at liberty, the seed of the alder is what these birds seek
most eagerly; but they do not despise the seeds of flax, hemp, and even
fir, and many other kinds. Being entirely grain-eating birds, their crop
has the power of softening the food before it passes into the stomach.</p>

<p>In the house, if in a cage, they eat poppy, rape, and hemp seed; when
at large, the first universal paste.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Breeding.</span>&mdash;Occasionally a few stragglers breed with us, but this is rare.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diseases.</span>&mdash;The disorders of this species are the same as those of the
siskin; but their feet are oftener diseased, and the toes skin off one after the
other. They may be kept from eight to ten years.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mode of Taking.</span>&mdash;In the spring and autumn, the lesser redpoles may
be taken in flocks in the area, or barn-floor trap, with a decoy of their own
species, or even with a siskin. Many may also be caught with such a decoy
on a decoy-bush. They are so silly, or so confiding, that they will
even allow themselves to be taken close by the bird-catcher, who is collecting
their entrapped companions. This stupidity, or simplicity, is common
in all birds that come from the more remote northern parts. Brought
up far from man, and out of reach of his pursuit, they know not that fear
and distrust which is felt by those that inhabit populous countries. Their
call is &#8220;<i>peweet</i>&#8221; and &#8220;<i>crec, creck hewid</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attractive Qualities.</span>&mdash;The lesser redpole pleases the eye more than
the ear; its feeble warbling being only, if I may thus express it, a low
continued clicking. It may be taught to draw water more easily than the
goldfinch, and it will also learn many other little man&oelig;uvres, for it becomes
very familiar, and will eat as soon as it is let loose after its capture.
The mutual tenderness of the male and female is very pleasing. They are
continually caressing each other with their bills, and even do the same to
siskins, linnets, goldfinches, and canaries, from which it appears very likely
that they would pair with these birds.</p></div>

<h4>THE GOLDFINCH.</h4>

<p class="center">Fringilla Carduelis, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; Le Chardonneret, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Der Distelfink,
<span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;Beauty</span> of plumage,&#8221; says Buffon, &#8220;softness of voice,
quickness of instinct, remarkable cleverness, proved docility,
tender affection, are all united in this delightful little bird;
and if it were rare, or if it came from a foreign country, it
would then be valued as it deserves.&#8221; It is five inches and
three quarters in length, of which the tail measures two. The
beak, five lines long, very pointed, and rather flattish at the
sides, is whitish, with the point horn-coloured. The shanks,
six lines high, are delicate and brownish. The front of the
head is a fine crimson, sometimes scarlet; a wide border of the
same colour surrounds the under base of the beak; the bridle,
as it is called, is black; the top of the head is black, which
colour extends downwards, from the nape on each side, dividing
the white on the cheeks from the white spot on the hinder part
of the neck; the under part of the neck is white; the hinder
part and the back are fine brown.</p>

<p>The female is rather smaller, and has not so much red round
the bill; the bridle is brownish; the cheeks are mixed with
light brown; the lesser wing coverts are brown; the back
dark brown. The size, or the want of some white spots at the
tips of the feathers, do not serve to distinguished the male from
the female, as some bird-catchers say; nor ought we either to
imagine that the size or number of these spots constitute different
varieties; for all these distinctions are accidental, and
depend on physical strength and age. Our bird-catchers think
the large ones that are nearly the shape of the greater redpole<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
form a distinct species, and they give them the name of Fir
Goldfinches, because they say they always build in fir forests.
Those that do not exceed the size of the red-breast, they call
Orchard Goldfinches, because they suppose they always build
in orchards. But these differences and pretences are imaginary,
because both are found of different sizes, the orchard goldfinch
large, and the fir, or wood goldfinch, quite small. The young
ones that are hatched first are always stronger and larger than
those hatched last, because they often carry off the food intended
for the latter, and, therefore, being better fed, they become
larger and stronger. This is sufficient to explain the
difference of size in different individuals of the same species.</p>

<p>The following varieties are better established:&mdash;1. The
goldfinch, with a yellow breast; 2. With a white head; 3.
With the head black&mdash;four young ones of this variety were
found in the same nest; 4. The white goldfinch; 5. And the
black goldfinch, this being either entirely black, which often
happens in a cage, from giving it too much hemp seed, or from
old age; or it only retains the yellow spot on the wings, which
is also occasioned by captivity. M. Schilbach, superintendant
of the menagerie of Cassel, tried an experiment on a whole
brood. He deprived the birds of the light of the sun, even
covered the cage with a piece of cloth, and, by these means,
obtained very black goldfinches, with only the yellow spot on
the wings; but they changed colour after moulting. Those in
which the black does not change are very old. It is, in fact,
a sign of approaching death.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Habitation.</span>&mdash;In their wild state goldfinches are found in all parts of
Europe, frequenting orchards, brambles, thickets, and mountainous districts,
interspersed with wood and fields, during the summer. These
birds are stationary, not changing their haunts in winter; they merely
assemble in the autumn in families, or rather in little flocks of fifteen or
twenty, seeking here and there places abounding in thistles, and only
when the snow becomes too deep leaving such localities for others more
accessible.</p>

<p>In the house, if kept in a cage, this should be a square one, because
these birds do not like hopping about the upper part, as they would be
forced to do, if in a bell-shaped cage, and also inclined to swing round.
When they run on the floor they should be given a small artificial tree for
a roost; for they like to perch on this whilst singing as well as sleeping.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Food.</span>&mdash;Their food, when wild, consists of all kinds of small seeds, such
as lettuce, goats'-beard, scorzonera, thistle, radish, and canary seed.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span></p>

<p>With us, in the house, they are principally fed on poppy, hemp seed,
properly varied with lettuce, rape, and canary seed. If allowed to range,
the second universal paste agrees very well with them. I have a goldfinch,
which appears in good health, and eats not only of all the vegetables brought
to table, but also meat, though, in their wild state, these birds never touch
insects<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">46</a>. They must have green food occasionally, such as chickweed,
water-cresses, lettuce, or endive. These birds feed largely, when loose in
the room, rarely leaving the food-dish, and driving off, if they can, with
loud cries, any of their companions who wish to approach. They will allow
those birds, however, to feed peaceably with them, that bear some analogy
to their species, at least, in the nature of the stomach, such as the canary,
siskin, and especially the lesser redpole, without distinction of male or female.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Breeding.</span>&mdash;The goldfinch prefers building in large orchards, at the tops
of trees, on weak and terminal branches. It makes the most beautiful nest
of any of our birds, except the chaffinch, it being finely rounded, very
elegant and firm. The outer part is constructed of fine moss, lichens,
stalks of grass, and slender twigs; the whole being interwoven with the
greatest nicety. The interior is lined with wool, horse-hair, and the
cotton or down of the thistle<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">47</a>, or willow. The female has rarely more
than one brood in the year, unless she has been disturbed, and, in this case,
the number of eggs is always diminished; on this account goldfinches never
appear to increase in number. On a sea-green ground, the eggs have pale
red spots and speckles, mingled with streaks of reddish black, which often
form a circle at the large end. The parent birds disgorge the food into the
young ones&#8217; throats. Before the first moulting the heads of the young
birds are grey. If it is only wished to take male birds from the nest, all
that have a whitish ring round the root of the beak, must be left. They
must be brought up on poppy-seed and the crumb of white bread, soaked in
milk or water. Of all the natural songs of birds, they imitate most easily
and perfectly that of the canary; they also pair with the canary, and produce
together fruitful young ones. For this purpose, a male goldfinch is
paired with one or two female canaries, which succeeds better than by
placing a male canary with a female goldfinch; the former being more
amorous, most favours this union, particularly if educated from youth. The
fruit of this union are not less distinguished for the beauty of their plumage,
often yellow, with the head, wings, and tail, of the goldfinch, than for the
sweetness of their song, whether natural or acquired.</p>

<p>If you are afraid that a pair of canaries you value, may not hatch their
eggs as you wish, place them in the nest of a goldfinch in your orchard, and
you may be certain that they will be properly matured, and the young ones
brought up in the best manner. When they are ready to fly, place them
in a cage, and suspend it by the side of the nest till they can feed themselves.
By this means you will have no trouble with their education.</p></div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><img src="images/i_167.png" alt="CANARY CAGE FOR PARLOUR." title="" height="553" width="500" />
<p class="caption">CANARY CAGE FOR PARLOUR.</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Diseases.</span>&mdash;Epilepsy is one of the commonest disorders of this bird. If
the eyes are weak and swollen, anoint them with fresh butter. Stupor and
giddiness being very properly attributed to too great a use of hemp seed, it
is best to suppress it entirely, and supply its place with the seed of lettuce
and thistles. This latter is so beneficial, that it would be well to give them,
from time to time, a head to pluck the seeds for themselves.</p>

<p>Old age makes them blind, and deprives them of their beautiful colours;
yet, notwithstanding all the evils with which they are afflicted, in a cage a
goldfinch has been known to live sixteen years, and even twenty, or twenty-four
years.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mode of Taking.</span>&mdash;In spring these birds are taken on a lure bush, with
a decoy bird of their own species. They will also enter the area, or barn-floor
trap, with chaffinches, if bundles of thistles are placed there; but it is
not without difficulty, for they are very watchful to avoid nets and lime-twigs.
In the winter, by building up bundles of thistles, and placing snares
and traps on them, several may be caught; but in autumn and spring
lime-twigs should be placed on them in preference. It is a still better
plan to place bundles of thistles in a tree stuck about with lime-twigs. The
goldfinch&#8217;s call is &#8220;<i>tziflit</i>,&#8221; or &#8220;<i>sticlit</i>,&#8221; which is its name in Bohemia.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attractive Qualities.</span>&mdash;The goldfinch is a very beautiful, lively,
active bird, always in motion, and turning continually to the right and left.
Its agreeable song, which is only discontinued during moulting, is a mixture
of tones and harmonies, more or less dwelt upon, and the oftener the sound
&#8220;<i>fink</i>&#8221; is introduced the more it is admired amongst us. There are some
goldfinches that utter it only once or twice in their strains, whilst others
will repeat it four or five times following. This species learn with difficulty
to repeat airs from the flageolet, or other birds&#8217; songs, and in this respect
is inferior to canaries and linnets; but it is remarkable for its docility.
Goldfinches have been seen to let off a small cannon, and imitate death.
When properly instructed they will draw up their food and water. They
are taught this by means of a chain or pulley, furnished with a soft leather
band, two lines wide, pierced with four holes, through which the wings and
feet are to be passed; the two ends meeting under the belly, and are retained
there by a ring, to which is fastened the chain that supports the
bucket containing the water or food. Whenever the little waterman wants
either, he draws up the chain with his beak, fixing it at intervals with his
foot, and thus succeeds in obtaining what he wishes; but if his little buckets
are suspended to a pulley, raising one makes the other descend, and he can
only enjoy his food and water in turn.</p>

<p>I have also seen goldfinches and siskins, placed in different cages, that
have little bells fixed to the seed drawer in such a way that the bird cannot
take its food without ringing them; the bells being harmonised, tolerably
agreeable chimes are produced, but one is soon tired of such trifles.</p>

<p>The goldfinch is taught to go and come at command, without any danger
of losing it, much sooner than the linnet, though the latter learns quite as
soon to build in the room. To accomplish this feat the winter should be
chosen, and the cage, containing a goldfinch that has not been rendered
tender by having been too long accustomed to the heat of the room, must
be placed on the outside of the window every day, or on a shelf intended
for it, and where the mice cannot reach it. Hemp seed must be scattered
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>round, and a bunch of thistle heads fastened by the side, the seeds of which
should be mixed with the hemp seed. Presently one or more goldfinches,
attracted by the call of the prisoner, collect, to take advantage of the
scattered food; as soon as you have succeeded so far it is useless to let the
decoy remain any longer exposed to the cold, which may injure it. It will
be quite sufficient to place the cage within the window, and to put on the
outside a cage as a trap, not for the sake of catching these birds, but to scare
away the sparrows, that would soon eat up all the seed unless thus prevented;
and in order that the trap may only close when you wish, the
door should be supported by a string, passing into the room, and loosened,
to catch the sparrows, but the goldfinches should be allowed to go in and
out at pleasure, till the snow is on the point of disappearing, then close the
trap on those you wish to keep: the birds thus captured should be placed
in a cage, where they will soon grow tame, and learn to go and return to
it. Whatever form this cage is of, the door should be hung so as to remain
open as long as is required, and be closed without noise or alarming the
bird, either by means of a spring, that may be acted on by the bird, without
his perceiving it, or by his pushing the door of it open on the inside. When
a goldfinch has been thus trained it may be let fly without fear the following
August, at the time of moulting. It is true that it will be lost for some
time, but it will not fail to return in December, when the ground is covered
with snow, and it will sing much more sweetly than it would had it been
kept prisoner. As soon as it has flown, a cage should constantly be hung
outside the window, and seeds placed in it, that, if it should chance to
return, it may find food; but it is rarely seen again till winter: at that
time the cage should be so arranged that the door may be closed as soon as
the bird enters, as it used to do in the room; the surest way is to attract
it by a call bird. It must not be allowed to come out so often as before,
and it will remain, without injury, shut up till the season arrives for giving
it its liberty again. The same course may be pursued for the tit, and with
still more success for the chaffinch, which does not enter the snares of the
bird-catcher as easily as the others. If it is feared that it may be caught
in a neighbouring area or barn-floor trap, it may be frightened from this
snare in future, by stretching a net once, in the orchard or garden near.
The greenfinch is the best for this man&oelig;uvre, as it is extremely fond of
hemp seed, is more rarely taken, and returns less wild than the chaffinch.
The birds that enjoy their liberty in the summer sing more finely than
without this advantage, and, what is almost incredible, though taken to a
distance of several leagues, they have always found their master&#8217;s house
again<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">48</a>.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> bird is four inches and three quarters in length, of
which the tail measures one and three quarters. The beak,
four lines long, becomes narrower towards the tip, which is
very sharp and brown; the rest is light grey, and in winter
white. The shanks, eight lines in height, are dusky; the top
of the head and throat are black; the cheeks, the back of the
neck, and back are green; the latter streaked with a dusky
colour; the rump, breast, under part of the neck, and the line
that passes over the eyes, are greenish yellow.</p>

<p>The throat of the male rarely becomes black till the second
year; the older it becomes the more of yellow and beauty it
attains.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span></p>

<p>The varieties are the black siskin, the white siskin, and the
speckled siskin. I have occasionally killed these birds with a
breast entirely black.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Habitation.</span>&mdash;In its wild state it is found throughout Europe; it is very
common in Germany, where it remains all the year<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">49</a>, but in winter it
wanders about in search of food, and most frequents the parts well planted
with alders. In the house, whether in a cage or not, it soon becomes very
familiar.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Food.</span>&mdash;When wild it varies according to the season; in summer it eats
in the woods the seeds of the pine and fir; in autumn, of hops, thistles,
burdock; in winter, of the alder and the buds of trees.</p>

<p>In the house its food is poppy-seed and a little hemp-seed bruised. If
allowed to range, the first universal paste suits it. It is a complete glutton,
and, though so small, eats more than the chaffinch; it is at the seed drawer
from morning till night, constantly eating, and driving off all its companions.
It does not drink less, and requires abundance of fresh water;
yet it bathes but little, only plunging the beak in the water, and thus
scattering it over its feathers, but it is very assiduous in arranging them;
it may be called a fop, always engaged with finery.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Breeding.</span>&mdash;The siskin rarely builds its nest among the alders, but
generally in the pine forests, placing it at the extremity of the highest
branches, and fixing it there with cobwebs, the threads of insects and lichens.
The outer part is well formed of small twigs, and the lining is formed of
finely divided roots. It has two broods in the year, each of five or six
eggs, of a light grey, strongly spotted with purplish brown, particularly at
the large end. The young males become finer each year till the
fourth.</p>

<p>The mules, produced by the siskin pairing with the canary, partake of
the two species, and are very prettily spotted if the canary is yellow; but
this union is not so easy as that with the green canary, which appears to
bear a nearer relation to the siskin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diseases.</span>&mdash;To the other maladies common to the birds of this family we
must add epilepsy, of which these birds often die<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">50</a>. They may, however,
be kept from eight to twelve years.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mode of Taking.</span>&mdash;With good traps and nets made for this purpose,
several dozen of these birds may be taken at once in the winter. They also
collect in numbers, in the spring, on the decoy bush, and they are so fearless,
that in the villages a person, who has his house situated near a stream
bordered with alders, need only place a siskin in the window, near a stick
covered with bird-lime, and he may catch as many as he wishes. I have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>caught some at my window in a cage strewed with hemp and poppy-seed,
by letting the door fall by means of a string, when the birds had entered,
one of the decoy birds in my room serving to attract them. When the
place where they drink at noon is discovered amongst the alders, numbers
may be caught by merely laying across the stream some branches covered
with bird-lime.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attractive Qualities.</span>&mdash;Their plumage and song are both attractive,
though with the latter several tones are mingled, that somewhat resemble
the noise made by a stocking-loom. This makes them great favourites
with stocking-weavers. They imitate tolerably the song of other birds,
such as that of the tit, the chaffinch, and the lark; but they cannot give a
musical air. Their carolling is only interrupted during moulting, and very
much tends to excite their companions to warble in their turn. The loss
of their liberty affects them so little, that they will eat as soon as let out of
the hand, after being caught, and on the second day will allow any one to
approach their cage without alarm. They are soon taught to draw up little
buckets, and many other little man&oelig;uvres that they execute gaily; there is
no difficulty in accustoming them to go and return if the winter is chosen;
the cage should be kept open at the window, and hemp and poppy-seed
scattered at the entrance; they will return there in general, and bring
several companions with them. This plan will not succeed so well in
March, September, and October, the time when these birds roam through
the country in search of food, though I have seen some tamed in this
manner return after a long absence.</p></div>

<h4>THE RING SPARROW.</h4>

<p class="center">Fringilla petronia, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; La Soulci, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Der Graufink, <span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Independently</span> of the beak, this bird may be taken for a
female yellowhammer, as it resembles it so much in its shape
and plumage. Its length is five inches three-quarters, of
which the tail measures two. The beak, five lines long, is
thick at the base, grey brown above, and white below. The
feet, ten lines high, are grey brown; the whole head is of a
reddish ash-colour, but a dirty white ring surrounds it from one
eye to the other.</p>

<p>The female is greyer on the upper part of the body, and the
front of the neck is only pale yellow.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Observations.</span>&mdash;Ring sparrows are found in most European forests, or
woods; they are common enough in several parts of Germany<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">51</a>, those that
inhabit the northern parts removing in winter; but the others are stationary.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span></p>

<p>They live on seeds and insects like the house sparrow, and make their
nests in hollows of trees. In the house they are fed on rape and poppy-seeds;
they also readily eat the first universal paste. They are less prized
for their warbling, which is insignificant, than for their beauty or rarity.</p></div>

<h4>THE SERIN FINCH.</h4>

<p class="center">Fringilla serinus, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; Le Serin vert, ou le Cini, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Der Girlitz,
<span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> bird is smaller than the siskin, its length not exceeding
four inches and a quarter, of which the tail measures one inch
and a third. The beak is short and thick, brown above and
white below; the iris is dark chestnut. The shanks are six
lines high, and are of a flesh colour. The plumage of the
male very much resembles that of the grey canary; the front
of the head, the circle round the eyes, a kind of collar, the
breast and belly, are pale jonquil-coloured, mixed with a little
green; the nape of the neck, the cheeks, the temples, and
lesser wing-coverts, are of a canary green, mingled with rust
colour and black.</p>

<p>The spots scattered over the plumage are not isolated, but
united to each other by an undulating line; they are so small
on the head, that it is only speckled.</p>

<p>It is necessary to examine the female very closely to distinguish
it from the siskin, for, with the exception of a reddish
grey tint, the colours are the same; but its beak is shorter, its
tail longer, and its shape freer.</p>

<p>From my latest observations this bird appears to be the same
as the citril finch; comparing them together in cabinets has
confirmed my opinion; but that which has decided me is the
testimony of my friend, Dr. Meyer, of Offenbach, who has
often seen and even fed in his house several of these birds.
From him I derive the rest of this article.</p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><img src="images/i_175.png" alt="SERIN FINCH." title="" height="569" width="500" />
<p class="caption">SERIN FINCH.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Habitation.</span>&mdash;It is not more than ten years since the serin was observed
between Frankfort and Offenbach. They arrive every year in large flights,
during March, and depart in October; but there are always some that
remain all the winter. Several were taken in January, 1800, when the
thermometer was at twenty-one degrees R&eacute;aumur, and I myself have seen
some near Offenbach at the end of February. They appear to prefer fruit
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>trees, yet in woods they also appear attached to beech and oak trees; but
I have never met with them by the sides of rivers or streams planted with
willows.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Food.</span>&mdash;They feed on all the small seeds found in fields and orchards,
particularly groundsel, plantain, garden pimpernel, and others of the same
kind.</p>

<p>In the house, rape, mixed with a little poppy seed, agrees very well with
them; a few grains of hemp seed and husked oats may be added from
time to time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Breeding.</span>&mdash;Their nest is generally placed on the lower branches of
apple and pear trees, sometimes on beeches and oaks, but never on willows
by the water-side. It is constructed of fine and divided roots, mosses,
lichens, principally of those which are farinaceous, the whole being entwined
with great nicety, and lined with a thick bed of feathers, horse-hair, and
pigs&#8217; bristles. They lay three or four, rarely five, eggs of the form of, but
rather smaller than, those of the canary; white, but having at the large
end a circle of spots and dots of a bright reddish brown. The hen sits on
the eggs thirteen or fourteen days, during which time the male feeds her.
He also helps to feed the young ones, which is done by disgorging the
food; the young perfectly resemble the grey linnet; they may be reared
easily on soaked rape seed; but it is best to take the parent birds, and place
them in the cage with their little ones, which they will continue to feed.
The young birds remain grey till after moulting, they then attain their full
plumage, as described before, but are never so beautiful in the house as in
their wild state. After being kept a few years in a cage, the yellow in
those taken full grown becomes pale, and fades at length to nearly white.
This bird will pair with the canary, siskin, linnet, or goldfinch.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mode of Taking.</span>&mdash;These birds are easily taken in the area, or barn-floor
trap, on a decoy bush, and with lime twigs placed near the stalks of
plantain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diseases.</span>&mdash;With the exception of consumption, of which one I had died,
I know of no disease they are subject to.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Observations.</span>&mdash;Of all house birds, these are the most sprightly and indefatigable
songsters. Their voice is not strong, but it is very melodious.
The song, with the exception of a few passages, is like the lark&#8217;k, and
might be mistaken for the canary&#8217;y. In their wild state they sing incessantly,
either perched on the outer branches of a tree, or whilst rising in
the air, and gently sinking again to their former situation, or whilst flying
from tree to tree. Their call resembles that of the canary, and their habits
are also similar to that species.</p>

<p>They are of a very affectionate character; when allowed to range the
room with siskins, linnets, and similar birds, they will caress all with the
beak, but seem to prefer the company of the goldfinch, whose tones they
will imitate, and improve their warbling by it. They are indeed very
attractive birds.</p></div>

<h4>THE CITRIL FINCH.</h4>

<p class="center">Fringilla citrinella, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; Le Venturon, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Der Citronenfink,
<span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> bird very nearly resembles the canary in its colour,
shape, song, and habits; but it is smaller and its notes weaker.
Its resemblance, however, is so marked, that I should be
inclined to suppose it the primitive wild stock, if the canary
had not its representative in those islands from which it takes
its name. The length of the citril finch is five inches, of which
the tail measures two. The beak is short, the feet flesh-coloured,
the plumage on the upper part of the body yellowish
green, streaked with brown; the under part of the rump greenish
yellow; the principal tint on the breast yellow.</p>

<p>The female is less spotted, and the general shade of colour
is lighter.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Observations.</span>&mdash;This species, inhabiting the south of Europe, occasionally
strays into the southern parts of Germany<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">52</a>, and the sweetness of their
song makes them much sought after. They should be treated in the same
manner as canaries.</p></div>

<hr />

<h4>THE LAPLAND FINCH.</h4>

<p class="center">Fringilla Laponica, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; Le Grand Montain, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Der Lerchenfink,
<span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> would be mistaken for a lark at first sight, as much
from its plumage as from the length of its spur. We should
also see them much oftener in Germany if the bird-catchers,
who catch them in their lark&#8217;s nests, did not take or kill them
both indifferently. Their decoys are the same as the buntings
(<i>Emberiz&aelig;</i>, Linn.), for though we cannot observe them much
whilst alive, we cannot be deceived as to their pairing with
finches (<i>Fringill&aelig;</i>, Linn.) buntings and larks. They are
about the size of the yellowhammer, six inches and a half in
length, of which the tail measures two. The beak is yellow,
with a black tip; the feet dark brown; the head blackish,
spotted with reddish white, sometimes quite black; a white
line passes from the base of the bill above the eyes, down each
side of the neck, curving towards the breast; the upper part
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>of the body is red, with brown spots; the throat and breast
are pale red; some males are black in the middle of the lower
part.</p>

<p>The female is paler in its colours; its breast is spotted with
grey and black; in fact its plumage resembles the field lark&#8217;k.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Observations.</span>&mdash;This bird is always found in the north, both in the old
and new world, and goes towards the south in winter. It is met with by
us on its arrival with the larks, and on its return with the snow bunting,
but it is oftenest taken with larks. Its call is a kind of shrill whistle, and its
song is very similar to the linnet&#8217;t; the female also warbles, but only in
the bullfinch&#8217;s style. It ranges the room like the lark, and if in a cage
hops about its perches like the chaffinch. It is fed on rape, hemp, and
poppy seed, which appear to agree with it very well. It may be fed at less
expense on the first universal paste, as it also likes meal worms. I think
that in its wild state it lives, like the chaffinch, on seeds and insects.</p></div>

<hr />

<h4>THE SNOW FINCH.</h4>

<p class="center">Fringilla nivalis, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; Le Niverole, ou Pinson de neige, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Der
Schneefin, <span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> name has been given it as much from its being found
on high mountains and the colour of its plumage, as for its
resemblance to the snow bunting. Its total length is seven
inches and a quarter, of which the tail measures two and a
half; the beak six lines long, very pointed, but thick at the
base, and of a glossy black; the feet ten lines high, dark
chestnut colour: its plumage is pretty; the top of the head,
cheeks, temples, nape, back, and sides of the neck are dark ash-coloured.</p>

<p>The female only differs from the male in the grey of the
head having a reddish tint, and the whole of the under part
of the body, being white; the breast has also a dirtier shade,
and the sides are spotted with black.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Observations.</span>&mdash;The snow finch inhabits the southern Alps, but is found
as far north as the middle of Germany. I have even seen them in Thuringia,
in company with the mountain finch; it is a sprightly bird, and
very fearless in a cage. It may be fed on rape, millet, and hemp seed;
but it appears to prefer the seed of the fir and nettle hemp (<i>Galeopsis
cannabina</i>): one would think that in its wild state it also fed on insects,
as it readily takes meal worms when offered them. Its call is &#8220;<i>kipp,
kipp</i>.&#8221; It sings a great deal, but its song is not more agreeable than the
mountain finch&#8217;h, to which it appears allied, and like that is only kept in
the house for its beauty and rarity.</p></div>

<h4>THE CANARY.</h4>

<p class="center">Fringilla canaria, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; Le Serin de Canarie, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Der Canarienvogel,
<span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> pleasing bird had its origin in the pleasant climate and
delightful valleys of the Canary Islands, and is now spread
throughout Europe, part of Asia, and as far as Siberia. The
beauty of its form, its plumage, and its song, united with its
great docility, soon gained it admittance into the most magnificent
abodes, where every one delights in rearing and preserving
it, whilst the fairest hands are often eager to present
it with the most delicate food. It was brought into our climate
as early as the beginning of the sixteenth century. The
arrival of the canary in Europe, is thus described:&mdash;A vessel,
which besides its merchandise was bringing a number of these
birds to Leghorn, was shipwrecked on the coast of Italy, opposite
the island of Elba, where these little birds, having been
set at liberty, took refuge. The climate being favourable, they
increased, and would certainly have become naturalised, had
not the wish to possess them occasioned their being caught in
such numbers, that at last they were extirpated from their
new country. From this cause Italy was the first European
country where the canary was reared. At first their education
was difficult, as the proper manner of treating them was
unknown; and what tended to render them scarce was, that
only the male birds were brought over, no females.</p>

<p>The grey of its primitive colour, darker on the back and
greener on the belly, has undergone so many changes from its
being domesticated, from the climate, and from the union with
birds analogous to it (in Italy with the citril finch, the serin;
in our country with the linnet, the green finch, the siskin, and
the goldfinch), that now we have canaries of all colours. If
we had not sufficient proof that canaries came originally from
the Fortunate Islands, we should think the citril finch, the
serin, and the siskin, were the wild stock of this domesticated
race. I have seen a bird, whose parent birds were a siskin and
serin, which perfectly resembled a variety of the canary which
is called the green. I have also seen mules from a female grey
canary, in which was no trace of their true parentage. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
grey, the yellow, the white, the blackish, and the chestnut,
are the principal varieties, and it is from their combination,
and from their tints, that we derive the numerous varieties
that we now possess.</p>

<p>Those canaries, that have the upper part of the body of a
dusky grey or linnet brown, and the under part the yellowish
green of the green-bird, with dark brown eyes, are the strongest,
and most nearly resemble the primitive race<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">53</a>. The yellow
and white often have red eyes, and are the most tender. The
chestnut are the most uncommon, and hold a middle rank for
strength and length of life between the two extremes. But as
the plumage of the intermediate ones is a mixture of these
principal colours, their value depends on the pretty and regular
manner in which they are marked. The canary that is most
admired amongst us now, is one with the body white or yellow,
the head, particularly if crested, wings and tail, yellowish dun;
the second in degree is of a golden yellow, with the head, wings
and tail black, or at least dusky grey. Next follow the grey
or blackish, with a yellow head and collar; the yellow, with a
blackish or green tuft, which are very much valued. As for
those that are irregularly spotted, speckled, or variegated, they
are much less sought after, and are used to pair with those of
one colour, white, yellow, grey, brown-grey<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">54</a>, and the like.</p>

<p>The female can scarcely be distinguished from the male, but
the male has generally deeper and brighter colours, a head
rather larger and longish, a longer body, a more elegant form,
neck not quite so short, and higher shanks. There is a feather
under the beak, of the shape of a bean, placed lower than the
rest, and the temples and circle round the eyes are of a deeper
yellow than the other parts of the body.</p>

<p>The length of the canary is five inches, of which the tail
measures two and a quarter: the beak, five lines long, is strong,
very pointed, and whitish; the shanks, eight lines in height,
are of a flesh-colour.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span></p>

<p>I shall end this description with an account of the different
mule birds obtained from the canaries.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mule Canaries.</span>&mdash;1. <i>Mules between a Canary and a Goldfinch</i>,
present in their plumage an agreeable mixture of the
colours of their parents. The most beautiful which I have
seen was greyish ash-colour in the middle of its crest, and silvery
white on the rest of its head and nape; a broad orange border
surrounded the beak, and the neck was adorned with a white
collar; the back was a dusky grey, with black streaks; the
rump white, the under part of the body of a snowy whiteness;
the under tail-coverts, the wings and first quill-feathers white,
but the others, as well as the coverts, black, edged with yellow;
the middle of the wing was also adorned with a beautiful
golden yellow spot; the white tail had a black spot on the
sides, the white beak was tipped with black, the feet were
white. The mother of this beautiful bird was white, with a
greenish grey crest. In general, one may be sure of fine birds
when yellow or white females are paired with goldfinches.</p>

<p>2. <i>Mules between the Canary and the Siskin.</i>&mdash;If the mother
be a green canary, the mules will resemble a female siskin;
but, if she is white or yellow, their colours are lighter, yet
without differing greatly from those of the siskin, which they
always resemble in shape.</p>

<p>3. <i>Mules between a Canary and a Green-bird, or a Citril
Finch.</i>&mdash;If the hen canary is neither white nor yellow, the
mules differ little from the common grey or green canary,
except in being more slender, and having the beak shorter and
thicker.</p>

<p>4. <i>Mules between a Canary and a Linnet</i> will be speckled if
the mother is white or yellow, but if she is grey they will be
like her, except that the tail will be longer.</p>

<p>The other mules are rarer, because more difficult to obtain,
as we shall see elsewhere.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Habitation.</span>&mdash;Except in the breeding season the male canaries are kept
alone in separate cages, which, whatever the shape, ought not to be less than
eight inches in diameter and a foot in height, with two sticks placed across
for the bird to perch on. The females may be allowed to range the room
with one wing clipped, or, what is better, kept in large cages, where, from
having plenty of exercise, their health and strength are better preserved.
In the small cages, glass vases should be placed on the outside, at the extremities
of the lower stick, to hold the food and water. These may be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>surmounted with a cap of tin, or something of the kind, to prevent the seed
from being so easily scattered. It is for this reason that the large seed
drawers in an aviary are covered with iron wire-work, leaving only sufficient
spaces for the heads of the birds to pass through. Cleanliness being a great
preservative against most of their disorders, the bottom of the cage should
be made to draw out, that it may the easier be cleaned and covered with
sand. This should be done every day, or at least several times a week.
These tender birds, being natives of a warm climate, and becoming more
delicate instead of hardier from being kept in the house, require a temperature
analogous to that of their native climate. They must be protected
from the cold, and never allowed to remain in winter in a cold room,
which would occasion many diseases, or even death. But, in summer,
it is proper to place them in the open air, and they enjoy it very much.
Never do they sing so gaily as on fine days, and their cages should therefore
be placed at the open window, that they may have the advantage of
the light and heat of the sun, which is particularly serviceable to them
whilst bathing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Food.</span>&mdash;This is an important point, for, in proportion as it is simple and
natural, it will be wholesome; and, on the contrary, the more it is mixed
and rare, the more injurious and productive of disease will it be. What I
have found the best is summer rape-seed; I mean that which is sown at
the end of spring, which is small and brown, in distinction from the winter
rape-seed, which is sown in the autumn, and which is large and black. This
seed alone agrees with canaries as well as with linnets: but to give them
the pleasure of variety, a little bruised hemp or canary, or poppy-seed, is
added to it, especially in the spring, when they are intended to breed.
Indeed a mixture of summer rape-seed, oatmeal and millet, or canary-seed,
may be given them as a great treat. But whatever seeds they may have,
they equally require green food, as chickweed in spring, lettuce and radish
leaves in summer, endive, water-cress, and slices of sweet apple, in winter.
As to that whimsical and complicated mixture, prescribed and used by
many people, of rape, millet, hemp, canary seed, whole oats and oatmeal,
poppy, lettuce, plantain, potentilla, and pink seeds, maize, sugar, cake, hard
biscuit, cracknels, buns, and the like, so far from being wholesome, it injures
the birds in every respect. It spoils their taste, weakens their stomachs,
renders them feeble, sickly, and incapable of bearing moulting, under which
they most frequently die. It is true, they may be accustomed to eat of
everything which comes to table, but to teach this habit is also to prepare
a poison for them, which though slow is not the less sure, and brings them
to a premature death; whilst every day we see bird-fanciers who are poor,
who hardly know the names of these delicacies, rear, on the simplest food,
a considerable number of the healthiest, cleverest, and strongest canaries.
We must, however, be guided in a great measure by the constitutions
of the birds. They should be daily supplied with fresh water, as well for
drinking as bathing, in which they delight. In the moulting season, a nail
or bit of iron should be put into the water, in order to strengthen the
stomach. Saffron and liquorice are in this case more hurtful than useful.
Grains of the sand, with which the bottom of the cage is strewed, afford
the birds a help to digestion. What has been said above, refers solely to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>the food of full-grown canaries; the young, which cannot feed themselves,
require a different diet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Breeding.</span>&mdash;A very important branch in the history of the canary is its
education, which is not without difficulties, but these are augmented by all
the refinements and artificial plans which some persons follow with so much
parade. A male of from two to five years of age should be chosen for
pairing; for experience has taught, that if a young male is placed among
older females, they will produce more males than females. A bird is known
to be old by the blackish and rough scales of his feet, and by his long and
strong claws.</p>

<p>Good males are valuable and scarce. Some are dull and melancholy,
always sad, and seldom singing; indifferent to their mates, which are
equally so to them; others are so passionate, that they beat or even
kill their mates and their young; others are too ardent, and pursue their
mates while they are sitting, tear the nest, destroy the eggs, or excite the
females so much that they voluntarily abandon them.</p>

<p>The females have also their defects. Some, too ardent, only lay without
sitting; others neglect to feed their young, beat them, and pick out their
feathers, so that the wretched little creatures die miserably; to others,
laying is so painful that they are too much fatigued to sit, or they lay each
egg only after a long interval. Quacks (for we find them on this subject
as on others) pretend to have specifics for the cure of these defects; but
their pretended remedies are mere deceptions, and the use of them causes
much trouble. The best plan is to remove the vicious birds, and to retain
only those which have none of the above-named bad qualities.</p>

<p>To obtain the most brilliant colours, those birds which have them clear,
and whose spots are distinct and regular, are paired together. This, of
course, can only be done in separate cages. In aviaries, where the birds
pair by choice, the offspring are generally mixed and blotted. A greenish
or brownish bird, placed with a bright yellow one, often produces dim
white, or other admired colours. It is better never to place together two
crested birds, because the offspring is apt to have a part of the head bald or
otherwise disfigured.</p>

<p>The best time for pairing canaries is the middle of April. Either one
male, and one or two females, are placed in a large cage, or many of both
sexes are united in a room or aviary, having the advantage of a south aspect.
Nests made of turned wood, or osiers, are given them, as straw ones
are too easily torn. It is a good plan to place in the room or aviary slips
of pine, which being cut in February do not lose their leaves. If a little
enclosure of wire-gauze can be fixed over the window, where the birds can
enjoy the fresh air, nothing will more effectually contribute to render the
young healthy and robust.</p>

<p>Birds, which are to be paired for the first time, should be previously
placed in the same cage for seven or eight days, in order to become acquainted
and accustomed to live together. If two females are to be caged
with one male, it is especially necessary that they should be together long
enough to leave off quarrelling, and the pairing cage should be divided into
two equal parts, communicating by a sliding door. This being done, a
lively male and one of the females should be placed in the first division;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>as soon as she has laid, the male should be moved into the other division,
the door of separation being shut; but as soon as the other has also laid,
the door may be left open: the male will then visit the females alternately,
and they will not trouble themselves about each other; but without
these precautions jealousy would incline them to fight, and destroy
each other&#8217;s eggs. When it is intended to place a great many females,
double or treble the number of males, in a room or aviary, the latter
should always be first paired with a single female, which will ever after
remain the favourite; and it will only be when she is about to sit that he
will pair with the others, and this is all the notice he will take of them, for
afterwards he will only notice their young. It is from these mothers,
however, that the most and the best birds are generally procured.</p>

<p>If the floor of the room or aviary is well covered with moss, little else
need be added for making the nests, otherwise they should be supplied
with the hair of cows and deer, hogs&#8217; bristles, fine hay, lint, wool cut two
or three inches long, paper shavings, and the like. That which is coarsest
serves for the outside, and the softest and finest for the inside. If they
have shrubs, traces of the natural instinct of the canary are soon observed
in the nests which they construct without the help of the turner or basket
weaver; but they are of an inelegant form, and the outside is not very
carefully finished. The females alone, as is usual among birds, are the
builders, the males only choosing the situation and bringing the materials.
It is in the nest, where the female is in continual motion, that the pairing
takes place; she invites the male by constant little chirpings, repeated
more quickly the nearer she is to laying. Seven or eight days are generally
reckoned from the first pairing to the laying of the first egg; the other
eggs, whose number varies, without exceeding six, are laid successively
every following day, and often at the same hour. The laying ended, pairing
continues during the first days of incubation.</p>

<p>If the pairs agree, they must be left entirely to themselves, without endeavouring
to use art to help nature, as many do. It is usual to take away
the first egg and substitute an ivory one, which is repeated with the others to
the last, preserving them in the mean time in a box filled with fine dry sand;
they are afterwards restored all together to the nest to be hatched<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">55</a>.</p>

<p>The females lay three or four times a year, from April till September;
there are some even so prolific that moulting does not stop them. The
eggs, of a sea-green colour, are at one end more or less spotted or marked
with maroon or violet. The period of incubation is thirteen days.</p>

<p>If, owing to the weakness of the male or female, it is suspected that
some of the eggs are barren, they should on the eighth day be examined by
holding them lightly between the fingers in the sunshine or before a candle;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>the good ones will be already filled with blood-vessels, while the bad will
continue clear, or even be already addled: these must be thrown away.
It is rare for the male to sit in his turn during some hours of the day, the
female seldom allowing it, for as soon as she has eaten she flies back to the
nest. If the male gives up his place readily, so much the better; if not,
she drives him away by force and by pecking him. She appears to know
his want of skill in this employment.</p>

<p>The near discharge of a gun, a door slammed with violence, and other
similar noises, will often kill the young in the shell; but their death happens
generally through the fault of a bad sitter.</p>

<p>As soon as the young are hatched, a small jar is placed beside the usual
feeding trough, which contains a quarter of a hard egg minced very fine,
white and yellow together, with a bit of white bread steeped in water, and
afterwards well pressed; another jar should contain rape seed which has
been boiled, and then washed in fresh water, to remove all its acrimony.
Some persons, instead of white bread, use biscuit, but this is unnecessary;
what, on the contrary, is very essential, is to take care that this food does
not turn sour, for it would then infallibly destroy the young nurslings.
This food I find by experience to be the best.</p>

<p>Now is the time when the male assumes his important duties of nursing-father.
These he fulfils indeed almost alone, in order to give his mate
time to rest before a new sitting. When it is necessary to bring up the
young by hand, a bit of white bread, or some biscuit, should be pounded
very fine, and this powder should be mixed with well-bruised rape-seed.
This composition serves, with a little yolk of egg and water, to make a
paste, which is given to the young birds on a quill cut like a spoon; each
nursling requires for a meal four beakfuls, well piled upon the quill, and
these meals must not be fewer than ten or twelve a day.</p>

<p>The young should remain warmly covered by the mother as long as
they continue unfledged<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">56</a>; that is to say, generally for twelve days: on the
thirteenth day they begin to eat alone. In four weeks they may be placed
in other cages of a sufficient size; but they must still for some weeks be
fed with the above-mentioned paste, conjointly with the food of full-grown
birds; for the sudden privation of this nourishment often occasions death,
especially when moulting.</p>

<p>Experience proves that generally those canaries which are hatched in a
large garden aviary, where they enjoy fresh air, and considerable space for
the exercise of their wings, are more vigorous, more healthy, and more
robust than those which are bred in rooms, and it is easy to understand the
reason.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span></p>

<p>I must not omit to mention here an important observation, which has
been often made, that if two females are given to one male, and one of
them happens to die, the other immediately takes charge of the abandoned
eggs, and assumes so completely the duties of foster-mother, that in order
rigorously to fulfil them she avoids and even repulses the caresses of her
mate.</p>

<p>Canaries pair not only among themselves in our aviaries and cages, they
also form connexions foreign to their species, and, provided the analogy is
not too remote, produce fruitful mules. Serins, citral finches, siskins,
goldfinches, or linnets, are the species which succeed best<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">57</a>. To succeed,
however, it is necessary that the birds should have been brought up from
the nest. The custom is to give an old male of one of the above-named
species to a female canary, the principal reason being that an old female
of one of those species, though she would not object to the union, could
never be induced to lay in an artificial nest, like a female canary. The
offspring of these mixtures combine the colours of the father and mother,
learn well enough if they descend from a linnet or goldfinch, but sing
badly if they come from a siskin or lesser redpole.</p>

<p>They are easily brought up with the paste mentioned above for canaries.
It is asserted that the mules of serins, citral finches, and goldfinches, are
fruitful. It is remarked, however, that their first eggs are very small, and
the young hatched from them very weak; but the next year the eggs become
larger, and the young stronger and more robust.</p>

<p>No sooner can the young canaries eat alone, which happens on the thirteenth
or fourteenth day, and sometimes even before they leave the nest,
than the males begin to warble, and some females also, but in a less connected
manner, which serves to point them out. As these pretty birds are
so docile as to neglect entirely their natural song and imitate the harmony
of our instruments, it is necessary immediately to separate from his companions
and from every other bird the young one which is to be instructed,
by putting him aside in a cage which is at first to be covered with a piece of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>linen, and afterwards with a darker cover. The air which is to be taught
should be performed five or six times a day, especially in the evening and
morning, either by whistling, or on a flageolet, or bird-organ; he will acquire
it more or less readily, in from two to six months, according to his
abilities and memory; if his separation from the other birds is delayed
beyond the fourteenth day, he will retain some part of his father&#8217;s song,
which he will always intermingle with his acquired air, and consequently
never perform it perfectly. The opinion of some, that the grayish canaries
have more facility in learning than the yellow or the white, is unfounded,
their only advantage over those of a different hue being that they are generally
more robust and vigorous. I have not either found that the true No.
3 suits them better than No. 1 or No. 2; these latter, on the contrary,
have appeared to me to please them best.</p>

<p>There is too much trouble and risk in allowing canaries to go in and out
of their cages for it to be worth the trouble of teaching them this. Notwithstanding
all my attention, and the care which I have taken to follow
exactly the prescribed rules, I have never succeeded; and the cleverest
bird-fanciers have assured me that it should never be attempted but when
they have young ones, and above all, there must be no canaries in the
neighbouring houses, which might entice them away. Indeed it is no easy
matter to accustom a bird to go and come. There, as in many other cases,
conclusions in regard to the species have been drawn from individuals. It
is certain that very few tame birds easily acquire this trick, and as I show
in their histories, with respect to others, probabilities are too often stated
as truths.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diseases.</span>&mdash;Birds which seldom enjoy the benefit of fresh and pure air,
prisoners destitute in their confinement of the means of exercise, must be
particularly subject to the common diseases which have been named, and
also to many other peculiar ones. The following are some of the disorders
incident to canaries.</p>

<p>1. <i>Rupture</i>, or <i>Hernia</i>: this is very common among young birds, and
is a kind of plethora, which produces inflammation in the bowels. The
symptoms of this disease are, thinness, the skin of the belly transparent and
distended, covered with little red veins surcharged with blood, the bowels
are black and knotted, and descend to the extremity of the body; there
are no feathers on the diseased part; the invalid does not eat, and dies in
a few days. Too nutritious, or too much food, being the cause of the
disease, the only remedy is a very severe regimen, and even then it can be
cured only in its first stages. The diseased birds must be immediately removed,
and fed with nothing but lettuce or rape-seed, in very small quantities.
A bit of iron should also be put in the water, and everything be
done to invigorate and purify them. It is very rare for young birds which
are brought up by their parents to suffer from this disease, as they never
over-feed them. In bringing up by hand this moderation should be imitated,
and they should neither be over-fed nor pampered.</p>

<p>2. <i>The yellow gall in the head and eyes</i>, arises from over heat; a
cooling diet is therefore the only remedy. If the tumour has grown to the
size of a grain of hemp-seed, it must be cut off, and the wound be anointed
with a little fresh butter, or bathed with urine.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span></p>

<p>3. <i>Sweating.</i>&mdash;There are some females which, during the time of incubation,
or while they are on their young, are subject to profuse perspiration;
the feathers of the belly are in consequence so wet as to destroy the
brood: as soon as this indisposition is perceived the invalid must be washed
with salt water, and after a few minutes be plunged into pure water, to
wash off the salt, and be dried in the sun as quickly as possible. This
operation is to be repeated once or twice a day till recovery; but as relapses
are frequent, it is better to separate the female, and not allow her
to sit.</p>

<p>4. <i>Asthma</i>, or <i>hard breathing</i>, which arises from an oppressed stomach,
generally yields to plantain and rape seeds moistened with water as the sole
food.</p>

<p>5. <i>Sneezing</i>, produced by an obstruction in the nostrils, is removed by
passing a very small quill up them to clear them.</p>

<p>6. <i>Loss of voice.</i>&mdash;It sometimes happens that after moulting a male
suffers the loss of its voice; it must then be fed with the same paste as is
prepared for young birds, adding some lettuce-seed, and, according to some
bird-fanciers, a bit of bacon should be hung to the cage, for it to peck.</p>

<p>7. <i>Constipation.</i>&mdash;The remedy for this is plenty of green food, as lettuce
leaves, water-cress, &amp;c., not forgetting bread and milk.</p>

<p>8. <i>Epilepsy</i>, which is common among many kinds of birds, may be produced
in canaries by particular causes, as great delicacy and timidity. We
should therefore avoid alarming them, either by catching them too suddenly
or violently, or by tormenting them in any way. They are to be cured as
has been already directed in the Introduction.</p>

<p>9. <i>Overgrown claws and beak.</i>&mdash;When the claws or beak want
paring, sharp scissors must be used, and care taken to avoid drawing blood,
lest the bird should be maimed. They often injure themselves when their
claws are too long, and get hooked in the wires of the cage, and continue
thus hanging. The females, in the same way, get entangled in their
nests.</p>

<p>10. <i>Lice.</i>&mdash;The parasite insects by which these little prisoners are often
tormented, are generally produced by slovenliness. Besides frequent
bathing, the cages must be cleaned with much care and vigilance, and
have plenty of very dry sand strewed over the bottom. These lice, like
bugs, retire during the day to cracks and crevices, which accounts for old
wooden cages being often infested. To get rid of them, hollow sticks or
stalks of rushes are used, which must be examined and changed every day.
The plan is good, but by using only tin cages, which may, more easily than
any others, be passed through boiling water, the object is more certainly
attained.</p>

<p>It is rare for canaries which are kept for breeding to live longer than from
seven to ten years; while others, if well used, may be preserved for
eighteen or twenty years.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attractive Qualities.</span>&mdash;The plumage, pretty form, and docility, the
charming familiarity which disposes it to nestle without fear or reserve
beside us, as well as its melodious song, have long introduced the canary
to all classes of society. Always before our eyes, the object of the most
assiduous care, and constant attention, it has afforded a thousand occasions
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>for studying its character, or rather the character and dispositions of the
different individuals of its species. It has been discovered that among them,
as among quadrupeds, and even man, some individuals are gay and others
melancholy; some quarrelsome, others mild; some intelligent, others
stupid; some with quick memories, others lazy; some greedy, others frugal;
some petulant, others gentle; some ardent, others cold.</p>

<p>Its singing, as strong as varied, continues uninterrupted during the year,
excepting at the time of moulting, and even this exception is not general.
There are some individuals which sing also during the night<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">58</a>.</p>

<p>Those which introduce into their melody some passages of the nightingale&#8217;e
song are the most esteemed of all canaries; they are called Tyrolean canaries,
because they are considered natives of the Tyrol, where they breed
many of these birds. The second are the English canaries, which imitate
the song of the wood-lark. But in Thuringia the preference is generally
given to those which, instead of a succession of noisy bursts, know how,
with a silvery sonorous voice, to descend regularly through all the tones of
the octave, introducing from time to time the sound of a trumpet. There
are some males which, especially in the pairing season, sing with so much
strength and ardour that they burst the delicate vessels of the lungs, and
die suddenly.</p>

<p>The female, particularly in the spring, sings also, but only a few unconnected
and unmusical sounds. Old ones which have done breeding often
sing in this way at all seasons.</p>

<p>Canaries are particularly remarkable for quickness and correctness of ear,
for the great ease with which they exactly repeat musical sounds, and for
their excellent memory. Not only do they imitate all the birds in whose
neighbourhood they have been placed when young<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">59</a>, mixing agreeably these
songs with their own, whence have arisen those beautiful varieties which
each family transmits to its descendants; but they also learn to repeat correctly
two or three airs of a flute or bird-organ, and even to pronounce distinctly
some short words. Females also have been known to perform airs
which they had been taught.</p>

<p>I shall conclude this article on canaries by pointing out the best rules for
obtaining and preserving good singers. The most essential is to choose from
among the young that which promises a fine tone, and to seclude it from all
other birds, that it may learn and remember nothing bad. The same precaution
is necessary during the first and second moulting; for being likely
to re-learn (if I may say so) its song, it would introduce into it with equal
ease foreign parts. It must be observed whether the bird likes to sing alone,
or in company with others, for there are some which appear to have such
whims, liking to hear only themselves, and which pout for whole years if
they are not humoured on this point. Others sing faintly, and display their
powers only when they can try their strength against a rival. It is very
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>important to distribute regularly to singing birds the simple allowance of
fresh food which is intended for the day. By this means they will sing
every day equally, because they will eat uniformly, and not pick the best
one day and be obliged to put up with the refuse the next.</p>

<p>About two spoonfuls of the dry food mentioned above, is sufficient for the
daily nourishment of a canary; what he leaves may be thrown to the birds
which are free in the room, and will serve as a variety to those which have
only the universal paste to satisfy their appetite.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> bird is smaller than the house sparrow, being only
four inches and a half long. The beak and feet are flesh-coloured;
the iris is white. All the plumage is of a bluish
black, or black with a hue of burnished steel; the female has
the upper part of the body covered with blackish feathers,
bordered with a yellowish brown; the rump gray, the under
part of the body dark yellowish brown; the tail-feathers black
with gray edges; the feet reddish; in some males the beak and
feet are black.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Observations.</span>&mdash;This bird is found in the woods of Cayenne, and the
neighbourhood of Carthagena in America. Its clear note is very agreeable.
It appears to sing with so much energy as to ruffle the feathers of the
head and neck. Its food consists of all kinds of seeds and fruits. Though
bread appears to be sufficient when caged, it is better to add rape, millet,
and poppy seed. It is easily tamed.</p></div>

tail is rather forked.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span></p>

<p>The female is all over of a deep blue, except the breast,
which is speckled.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Observations.</span>&mdash;These birds are very numerous during the summer in
Carolina, which they quit in the winter in small flights. Juniper berries
are their principal food; and they eat them with pleasure when caged.
They are generally fed with rape and canary seed; but are soon accustomed
to all the food of the aviary. They are more admired for their
plumage than their song.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> bird is as large as a linnet, its length being about four
inches and a third. The beak and feet are whitish; the iris
is nut-brown; the forehead is black, and the rest of the body
yellow.</p>

<p>The female has no black on the forehead; the upper part
of her body is of an olive green; the throat, breast and rump
of a bright yellow; the belly and vent white; the wings and
tail blackish.</p>

<p>The young males at first exactly resemble the females, the
only difference being the black forehead.</p>

<p>These birds build twice a year, in spring and autumn.
Edwards says that they also moult twice, so that it is only
during the summer that they are of the colours described
above. In the winter the top of the male&#8217;s head is black;
the throat, neck, and breast, yellow; the rump also yellow, but
of a whitish hue; the feathers of the back olive brown, lighter
at the edges; the wings and the tail black, with white edges
to almost all the feathers.</p>

<p>The female is generally of a lighter colour, and the top of
the head is not black: thus we perceive that in winter these
birds very much resemble our siskins.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Observations.</span>&mdash;These American birds repair in the summer in great
numbers to the state of New York; they live on the seeds of different
kinds of thistles, like our goldfinches, and eat the same food when caged.
They are easily tamed, and sometimes even lay in captivity. Their eggs
are of a pearl gray, but I am ignorant whether they are ever productive in
confinement.</p></div>

throat, the lower part of the belly, and the thighs, are black;
the lower part of the head and the rest of the body are chestnut,
with a varying brown on the back and shoulders.</p>

<p>The female has a red beak, and a little purple under the

<h4>THE LIVER-BROWN FINCH.</h4>

<p class="center">Fringilla hepatica, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; Der Leberfarbene Fink, <span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> is about the same size as the last, which it somewhat
resembles in plumage; but its air and manner are very
different. Its length is four inches, of which the wedge-shaped
tail measures one and three quarters. The beak is
like that of the sparrow in form, of a blood-red colour, tipped
with black; the eyelids are yellowish and bare; the iris is
reddish brown; the feet are flesh-coloured; on the cheeks is
a dark purple spot; the throat, half the breast, the sides, and
the rump, are of a dirty greenish blue: the upper part of the
body is of a dark liver-brown, the belly of a lighter shade of
the same colour; the wings are of a deep brown, with the edges
of the pen-feathers of the same colour as the back; the under
side tending to blue, with black tips. I do not know the
female.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Observations.</span>&mdash;This species inhabits the shores of Africa; it is very
lively, and its call is &#8220;<i>tz&auml;</i>.&#8221; Its weak but sweet song resembles that of
the wood wren. It is fed on canary-seed.</p></div>

<span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span>, in form and habits, very much resembles our redpole.
Its length is four inches and a half, of which the forked tail
contains one and three quarters. The beak is short, and not
flattish, blunt at the tip, and of a dingy flesh-colour; the feet
are flesh-coloured; the circumference of the beak is black;
that of the eyes, with the sides of the throat, is spotted with
white; the top of the head, the upper part of the throat, the
back, and the little coverts of the wings, are of a brownish ash-colour.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Observations.</span>&mdash;Angola is the native country of this bird. As to the
song, it is sweet and flute-like, very like that of the linnet, but more
melodious. It is fed with rape and canary seed. The young males have
the same plumage as the females.</p></div>

<span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> bird is exactly of the form of our common goldfinch.
Its length is four inches and a half, of which the tail measures
one and a half. The beak is half an inch long, and of a carnation
colour; the iris is chestnut; the feet gray; the front of
the head, the back of the eye, and the throat, are of a bright
red; the bridle is ash-colour; the upper part of the head, the
neck, and the back, are yellowish green.</p>

<p>The female has a light yellow beak, the top of the head and
the neck ash-colour; the little coverts of the wings and rump
yellow-green; the feathers of the tail brown, edged with pale
red; the rest like the male.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Observations.</span>&mdash;This species is found in Brazil. The male pleases the
ear by his song, as much as the eye by his plumage. It appears that by
feeding them simply with rape and canary seed they may be preserved
healthy for many years.</p></div>

<h3>WARBLERS.</h3>

<p>The characteristics of this group are a conical beak, sometimes
tending to cylindrical, sharp, generally weak, and the
upper mandible fixed. Insects are the food of the greater
number; some also feed on berries and worms. The nests are
for the most part well made, and the male sits alternately with
the female.</p>

<h4>THE SKY-LARK.</h4>

<p class="center">Alauda arvensis, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; L&#8217;Llouette, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Die Felderche, <span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> bird is very generally known. Its length is seven
inches, of which the tail contains three. The beak is weak,
straight, cylindrical, and terminating in a point; the mandibles
are of an equal length, the lower one whitish, the upper black
horn colour; the iris is grayish brown; the feet of the same
colour, but yellower in the spring; the height of the shanks is
nearly an inch, and the hind claw is much longer than the hind
toe itself.</p>

<p>The female is distinguished by its smaller size, by the
absence of the white line round the cheeks, by the great number
of black spots on the back and breast, and by the purer
white of the breast.</p>

<p>In the house we sometimes meet with the two following
varieties:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. <i>The white lark</i>, which is either clear white or yellowish
white. He is occasionally found wild.</p>

<p>2. <i>The black lark.</i> The whole body of this variety is black
with a rusty tinge, and the belly feathers are edged with white.
I am ignorant whether this variety has ever been found wild;
but it is not uncommon in dwelling houses, especially when the
cages are fixed in a dark place where the rays of the sun cannot
penetrate; in moulting, their colour passes away to give
place to the primitive plumage, which never happens to the
white variety.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Habitation.</span>&mdash;In a wild state, the sky-lark is found almost all over the
world, frequenting fields and meadows, and by preference plains. It is a
bird of passage which generally arrives in our regions in the beginning of
February, and departs in great flights in the month of October<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">60</a>. No bird
of passage returns so soon as the lark; but as it lives not only on insects,
but eats all kinds of seeds and even grass, it can seldom be in want of provision
even in the severest weather.</p></div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><img src="images/i_197.png" alt="A CAGE." title="" height="439" width="500" /></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>In rooms, it is common to let it hop about, giving it a retired corner to
sleep; it is, however, also kept in cages, where it sings best. Whatever
form may be given to these cages, they must be at least eighteen inches
long, nine wide, and fifteen high; the bottom should have a drawer in
which enough of river sand should be kept for this scratching bird to
be able to roll and dust itself conveniently. It is also a good plan to have
in a corner a little square of fresh turf, which is as beneficial as it is agreeable.
The top of the cage must be of linen, since, from its tendency to
rise for flight, it would run the risk of wounding its head against a covering
of wood or iron wire, especially before it is well tamed. The vessels for
food and drink must be outside, or, which I prefer, a drawer for the food
may be introduced in the side of the cage: sticks are not necessary, as the
lark does not perch. When it is allowed to hop free in a room, the latter
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>must be very clean and neat, otherwise a thread or hair may entangle the
feet, and if not removed it easily cuts the skin, maims the bird, and the
entangled toes shrink and fall off.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Food.</span>&mdash;When wild, the food consists of insects, especially ants&#8217; eggs;
also of all kinds of seeds, and in autumn of oats, which these birds skin
by striking them against the ground, their beak being too weak to shell
them alone. In the spring the sprouting seeds and young buds, also the
blades of young grass, are eaten, and grains of sand help their digestion.</p>

<p>In the house, if the lark is hopping about, nothing is better than the
first universal paste described in the Introduction; but if caged the second
will suit it better. Poppy-seed, bruised hemp, crumb of bread, and plenty
of greens, as lettuce, endive, cabbage, or water-cress, according to the
season, must be added. A little lean meat and ants&#8217; eggs are favourite
delicacies, which make it gay and more inclined to sing. When old larks
are first made prisoners, they must be fed only with oats and poppy-seed to
reconcile them to captivity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Breeding.</span>&mdash;The lark lays but once a year in cold countries, twice in
the temperate, and three times in the warmer climates. Its nest, formed
on the ground in a little hollow, is made without much art of straw, and
the wool and hair of animals, and by preference in hollow ground or among
the summer crops of grain. The eggs, in number from three to five, are
of a whitish gray, spotted and dotted with dark gray; incubation lasts fourteen
days. By the end of April the young are often hatched, and are at
first only fed with insects, and leave the nest before they can fly; but they
nevertheless continue to be fed by the mother till they can follow her in
her excursions. Before the first moulting all the upper part of the body
is dotted with white; if it is wished to take nestlings, they must be removed
from the nest when the tail is about three quarters of an inch long.
They are fed with crumb of white bread, and poppy-seed steeped in milk;
some ants&#8217; eggs or a little minced lean meat will be a wholesome addition.
The males are soon distinguished by their yellow colour. If it is intended
to teach them to perform a tune, their instructor must commence before
they are ready to fly, for by that time they already begin to record their
natural song. They must also be completely separated from other singing
birds, otherwise the great flexibility of their organs, joined to their memory,
will infallibly cause them to adopt the song of such birds as they
are near; and even old larks, brought into my bird-room, have learnt
to imitate perfectly the nightingale and chaffinch. They vary, however,
very much in this respect. Some females in confinement lay without the
presence of a male, and others pair, but I have never yet succeeded in
making them sit. One of my neighbours, notwithstanding the greatest
care, has succeeded no better, though he had a female which laid from
twenty to twenty-five eggs annually. There would undoubtedly be a better
chance of success in a large garden aviary<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">61</a>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diseases.</span>&mdash;Besides those which have been named in the Introduction,
these birds are very subject to a kind of scurf or yellow crust round the
base of the beak. The best remedy is to take care that they have good
food; the second universal paste agrees with them particularly well; but
greens, ants&#8217; eggs, meal-worms, or other insects, must be added. With this
food they may be preserved healthy for many years in the house. Instances
have been known of larks which have lived in this way for thirty years.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mode of Taking.</span>&mdash;It would take too long a time to describe all the
modes of catching larks which are in use. It is enough to say that with
day and night nets, known by the name of lark nets, so large a number of
these birds are taken alive in the open country, that it is easy to have a
choice of both males and females. This lark snaring is accomplished by
placing a considerable number of nets perpendicularly like walls, which are
called day-nets, towards which, in the dusk, the birds are forced by means
of a long rope, which is drawn along the ground, and drives them forward;
in the night a square net called a night-net is carried to a spot where it is
known that many larks are collected in the stubble, and there they are
covered just when they begin to flutter.</p>

<p>If, in the spring, it is wished to procure a good singing male, for some
are better than others, a lark whose wings are tied, and with a little forked
lime-twig fixed to its back, must be carried to the place where such a bird
is to be found. As soon as it is let loose, and the desired male has perceived
it from high in the air, he will fall upon it like an arrow and attack
it; but soon, the dupe of his jealousy, he will find himself caught by the
lime.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attractive Qualities.</span>&mdash;The very pleasing song of the sky-lark consists
of several stanzas or strains, composed entirely of trills and flourishes,
interrupted from time to time by loud whistling. I have already said that
the lark has great abilities for learning. The young readily imitate the
notes of all the birds in the same room with them, and the old sometimes
succeed also: this, however, is not general; for among birds as among
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>men, memories vary in power. Some have a stronger and more melodious
voice; there are some which, in confinement, begin to sing as early as
December, and continue till they moult; while others, less lively, delay
till the month of March, and cease to sing in the month of August. In
its wild state, the lark begins to sing in the first fine days of spring, the
season of pairing, and ceases at the end of July; this, however, is not
without exceptions, as some individuals continue till the end of September.
It belongs to the small number of birds which sing as they fly, and the
higher it rises the more it appears to elevate its voice, so that it may be
heard when it is out of sight. In the country, it very seldom sings when
on the ground; in the room it often does, and with ease, and it becomes
so tame as to come and eat from the table or the hand.</p></div>

<hr />

<h4>THE CRESTED LARK.</h4>

<p class="center">Alauda cristata, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; Le Cochevis, ou la grosse Alouette hupp&eacute;e; Die Haubenlerche,
<span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> bird is stronger than the sky-lark, and its colour is
lighter, but its length the same. The beak is lead-coloured,
and brown at the point, is also rather longer; the iris is dark
brown. The shanks are an inch high, and yellowish gray; the
head, the cheeks, the upper part of the neck to the upper part
of the back, are of a reddish gray, caused by the wide red
edges of the feathers, which are brown in the middle; a reddish
white line, hardly perceptible above the eyes, but very distinct
beyond, extends from the nostrils to the ears; eight or ten long-pointed
blackish feathers rising on the head form a beautiful
perpendicular crest.</p>

<p>The crest of the female is lower, but her breast is covered
with more numerous and rounder spots than the male.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Habitation.</span>&mdash;When wild it is only in autumn and winter that they
appear in Saxony in small or large flights, beside the high roads, on dunghills,
near barns and stables, among sparrows and yellowhammers; they
are also found all over Europe, from Sweden to Italy<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">62</a>; in summer, they
frequent the thickets and bushes of the plains, fields, and meadows, or they
inhabit the hollows of ditches, paths in woods, and elevated villages. They
depart in October.</p>

<p>In the house they may be kept in cages, like the sky-lark, or be left to
run about. I know no bird whose feathers grow so quickly; if the wings
are kept clipped, this must be repeated every three or four weeks, as by that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>time they are so much grown that they may serve for flying about the
room.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Food.</span>&mdash;When wild this bird lives, like the sky-lark, on insects, different
sorts of seeds, and oats. In the house it is fed with the same things, but
it becomes more robust and healthy than the sky-lark.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Breeding.</span>&mdash;This species forms its nest on the ground, under little dry
bushes, under garden vegetables, on clay walls, and even on thatched roofs.
The eggs, in number from four to five, are of a rusty gray, shaded and
spotted at the upper end with dark brown. The first plumage of the young
before moulting is variegated white. They are taken from the nest when
the feathers are half grown to be tamed and taught airs, or to have them
instructed by other birds whose song is admired; they learn every thing
with the greatest ease.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diseases.</span>&mdash;They are the same as those of other larks. A lousy disease
may be added. I possess two male crested larks, one of which has hardly
any of the lice which so commonly torment birds, whilst the other, which
is nevertheless as gay and musical, is so covered with them that he cannot
be touched without having the hand filled with these nasty insects. He
has been with me four years, and though he has maintained for a long time
millions of these parasites, he continues in good health, which I attribute
to his abundant supply of good food.</p>

<p>Is this produced by a difference in the cleanly dispositions of these two
birds, or is it a constitutional difference?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mode of Taking.</span>&mdash;When, in winter, any spot has been remarked
which the larks prefer, a place must be cleared from snow, some oats and
poppy-seed be thrown upon it for a bait, and limed twigs, nets, or even a
simple gauze, be conveniently arranged, and soon plenty will be caught.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attractive Qualities.</span>&mdash;The song of the crested lark is, in my opinion,
very inferior to that of the sky-lark; it seems composed of the warbling of
that and of the linnet; this bird sings also in the night. Its time of singing
lasts from February to August, but longer in those birds which have been
tamed from the nest. It has not the tottering gait of the sky-lark, but
runs nimbly, and moves its crest in the most expressive way. It is rather
quarrelsome, and has the peculiarity that when it fights it continues to sing.</p></div>

<hr />

<h4>THE WOOD-LARK.</h4>

<p class="center">Alauda arborea, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; Le Cujelier, ou L&#8217;Llouette des Bois, ou La Loulou,
<span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Die Waldlerche, <span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> charming species is one-third smaller than the field-lark,
and resembles it much in form and gait. The beak is
black above, brown below, tending to carnation at the tip.
The shanks, three quarters of an inch high, are of a brownish
flesh-colour. The top of the head is reddish brown, with four<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
dark brown lines; its long feathers render the head large, and
they may be raised at pleasure into a crest, which from eye to
eye is surrounded by a whitish ash-coloured line. The tail is
very short.</p>

<p>The female, more beautiful, is of a paler ground, with darker
ornaments; her breast more spotted; the crest on her head
more prominent, and the line round the cheeks more distinct.
It is a well attested observation made on all our indigenous
species, that the individuals with the most spots on a lighter
ground, and of a clearer white, are certainly females.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Habitation.</span>&mdash;When wild these birds inhabit the temperate regions of
Europe, in summer the woods of the plain, near fields and meadows, and in
the woods of the hills they alternate between heaths and pasture lands.
After breeding time they assemble in small flocks of ten or twelve. They
are thus found in the stubble, at their departure in October, and their
return in March.</p>

<p>In the house I prefer letting them run about, because my experience
shows that they sing better in this way than when caged. They must be
well supplied with river sand, as well to roll and dust themselves as to pick
out grains necessary for their digestion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Food.</span>&mdash;When wild, in summer, the food consists of insects; in autumn,
of rape, millet, seed, and oats; in spring, before they can find insects and
worms, they are satisfied with the young buds of herbs, water-cresses,
and, on an emergency, with the buds of the filbert.</p>

<p>In the house, as this species is more delicate than the preceding, it is well
to vary the food, and to give it occasionally, independent of the universal
paste, poppy-seed, oats, hemp, sprouting wheat, fresh curds, fresh and dried
ants&#8217; eggs, minced ox heart, meal worms, and the like. When one of
these birds is caught by the net or otherwise, the best things to induce it to
eat when it reaches the bird-room are poppy-seeds and ants&#8217; eggs.</p>

<p>I have seen two wood-larks which had been kept in a cage for eight
years, very healthy and gay, with their feet quite free from disease, and
singing perfectly. Their food consisted of crumbs of white bread and
pounded hemp-seed mixed together; a piece of white bread, enough for the
day, soaked in milk, which was poured boiling over it every morning, was
also furnished; and finally, some ants&#8217; eggs, given two or three times a day
as a treat. The bottom of the cage was also covered with sand, which was
changed regularly every day, as well as the water. They were always kept
in summer outside the window, exposed to the free air, screening them from
the sun by covering the top of the cage with a sheet of paper or piece of
linen by way of parasol. The success of this mode of treatment sufficiently
proves its advantage. The cage was furnished with two bars, because the
wood-lark perches.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Breeding.</span>&mdash;The wood-lark builds among the heath, under juniper
bushes, in hedges, high grass, or under a green hillock in fields near the
woods, or in copse wood. The nest is made of dry blades of grass, mixed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>with moss, wool, and hair. The eggs are variegated with light gray and
brownish violet. The young may be bred up with bread soaked in milk,
and ants&#8217; eggs. They readily learn the different songs of the birds with
which they are imprisoned; but this medley is less agreeable to me than
their natural song.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diseases.</span>&mdash;To the list of diseases already given, to which the wood-lark
may be subject, I must add one which is peculiar to it. This attacks the
feet and renders them extremely brittle. I cannot too strongly recommend
to clean them carefully from everything which might entangle them; a
single hair may cut them, so that the toes shrivel, or ulcerate and fall off.
They become so brittle with age, that with all my cares I could never keep
any beyond four years; the least thing breaks them. Most of the wood-larks
which I have had perished from broken legs; and this peculiarity I
have remarked in no other species of bird.</p>

<p>We see from these instances, that if birds allowed to hop about a room
enjoy more space and free exercise, they are also subject to more inconveniences
and disadvantages than caged birds. Their food is neither so appropriate
or regular; they cannot be kept so clean; their feet are almost
inevitably injured; and lice devour them, without the power of prevention.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mode of Taking.</span>&mdash;The wood-lark may be caught on the nest by means
of limed twigs; but as it is very cruel to separate a pair, and thus to destroy
a whole family, it is better to wait till autumn, and to use the night-net.
They may be caught early in the spring, when there is snow on the ground,
by placing limed twigs or nets in cleared places. This is the best method
of catching them. It is true that this plan will not succeed in all years;
but another may be substituted, if we have a decoy wood-lark, by placing
it under a folding net, in a field frequented by a flight of this species, which
will not fail to join it. The same means also may be used as with the chaffinch,
namely, by tying the wings of a wood-lark with a limed twig on his back,
and letting him run to the place where there is a male of the same species.
By this means the bird-fancier may obtain whatever kind of singer he prefers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attractive Qualities.</span>&mdash;Of all the species of larks the wood lark has
the finest song, and to my taste it is, of all our indigenous birds (always
excepting the nightingale), the one whose natural notes are the most
delightful. Its clear flute-like voice executes a sonorous, tender, and somewhat
melancholy air. In the country it rises from the tops of the trees so
high in the air that the eye can scarcely discern it, and there remaining stationary,
the wings and the tail expanded, it sings uninterruptedly for hours
together; it sings in the same manner when perched on a tree.</p>

<p>In the house, it is from a retired corner, tranquil and motionless, that it
utters the different modulations of its beautiful voice. The singing time in
its wild state is from March to July; in the house, from February to
August. The female, like other larks, sings also, but her strains are shorter
and less sustained. These birds appear to be subject to whims: I have
seen some which would never sing in a room or in the presence of an
auditor. These perverse birds must be placed in a long cage outside the
window. I have remarked that in general these obstinate birds are the
best singers. Their abrupt step and various frolics, in which they raise the
feathers of the head and neck, are also very amusing.</p></div>

<h4>THE TITLARK.</h4>

<p class="center">Anthus arboreus, <span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>; L&#8217;Llouette Pipi, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Die Waldpieper,
<span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> is the smallest of our larks; its length is but five inches
and a half, two and a half of which belong to the tail, which it
carries and moves like a wagtail, and by this characteristic it
seems to stand intermediate between the larks and the wagtails.
The sharp beak is dark brown above and whitish below; the
iris is brown. The shanks are three quarters of an inch high,
and light flesh-coloured; the angle of the hind toe is short and
crooked. The head, rather oval than round, is, with the neck,
back, rump, and sides, of an olive brown with black wavy
spots.</p>

<p>The female differs from the male only in the paler yellow of
the throat, neck, and breast; the white spot in the second tail-feather
is also smaller, and the two transverse bands on the
wings are whiter. The young males of the first year have the
under part of the body of a lighter yellow than those which are
older.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Habitation.</span>&mdash;When wild, with the exception of the most northern parts,
this species is found all over Europe. They build in great numbers in
Germany and England, in mountainous and woody places, and establish
themselves by preference on the skirts of forests, in fields, and orchards, in
their neighbourhood, or in the cleared parts of woods. In the month of
August they arrive in small flights in fields and enclosures planted with
cabbages, where caterpillars abound. In September they pass into the oat
fields, and in October they are caught in the nets with the common larks.
The time of their return is about the end of March; and if the cold is severe
they collect by thousands in damp fields and near warm springs. One
peculiarity of this species is the having during the rest of the year a call
different from that of the breeding season. It no longer perches on trees
and bushes, but remains on the ground, crying &#8220;<i>pitt, pitt</i>,&#8221; (or rather, I
think, &#8220;<i>guik, guik</i>,&#8221;) while in the sitting time the cry is more tender,
expresses more solicitude, &#8220;<i>tzip, tzip</i>,&#8221; and is heard only in the immediate
neighbourhood of the nest. As soon, therefore, as this cry strikes the ear,
we may be sure the nest is not far off; and if the young are hatched we
shall soon see the father or mother with a beakful of insects, redoubling and
increasing the cry as they approach their precious charge. The other cry of
&#8220;<i>pitt</i>&#8221; or &#8220;<i>guik</i>&#8221; is never heard at this season; whence it happens that
sportsmen and bird-catchers make two species of this same lark; one they
name the heath lark, whose call in the woods is &#8220;<i>tzip</i>,&#8221; and the other the
cabbage lark, which in the fields calls &#8220;<i>guik</i>.&#8221; I have never been able to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>convince these people of their error, but by showing them in my bird-room
the same lark which called &#8220;<i>guik</i>&#8221; in the autumn and winter, and &#8220;<i>tzip</i>&#8221;
in the summer. We may judge by this circumstance how many mistakes
and errors may slip into natural history, when in the determination of species
we meet with things which we can neither see nor verify.</p>

<p>In confinement, I have been accustomed to let the calling lark range
freely among my other birds, because I would not trouble myself to give
it a particular cage. I own, however, that it would be better so circumstanced,
on all accounts, as well in regard to its health as its song. This
cage should be long, like that of the sky-lark, and furnished with two
sticks, because this kind perches.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Food.</span>&mdash;When wild, the food consists of all sorts of flies, grasshoppers,
caterpillars, butterflies, beetles, and ants&#8217; eggs.</p>

<p>In confinement, as it is the most delicate of its species, the food must be
frequently changed and varied. Besides the universal paste, we should
sometimes give it the common food of the nightingale, sometimes bruised
hemp, mouldy cheese, meal worms, and ants&#8217; eggs.</p>

<p>It is very difficult to accustom it to take the food of the bird-room. As
soon as it arrives, we must throw it some meal worms, ants&#8217; eggs, or
caterpillars; as soon as these are eaten, some must be mixed with the universal
paste and with all its food; it will thus insensibly grow accustomed
to the common food.</p>

<p>This lark does not roll in the sand, and dust itself like the others, but
it thrusts its beak into water and sprinkles itself; another indication of its
approximation to the wagtail, as was mentioned above.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Breeding.</span>&mdash;The titlark lays twice a year. The nest, placed on the
ground in a cleared part of the woods, or under a bush or hillock, in a
tuft of grass, in a field or orchard, is made in the simplest manner; coarse
hay outside and finer within, with some wool and hair, are all the materials.
The eggs, in number from four to five, are gray mottled with
brown; the young escape as soon as possible, having but too many enemies
to fear on the ground.</p>

<p>They may be brought up with ants&#8217; eggs and white bread soaked in
boiled milk, to which a few poppy-seeds are added. They easily learn to
imitate the songs of the birds in the same room with them, especially that
of the canary, without however attaining any great perfection.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diseases.</span>&mdash;Independent of those which are common to the other birds
of its species, it is particularly subject to the loss of its feathers out of the
moulting season; if it is not at once supplied with food more nutritious,
and better suited to its natural habits, as ants&#8217; eggs, meal worms, and other
insects, it soon dies of atrophy. At the best it can only be preserved five
or six years<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">63</a>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mode of Taking.</span>&mdash;To take the bird from its nest by a limed twig, and
thus destroy the young family by hunger and misery, is a cruelty which
none but a harsh insensible amateur could resolve upon. I prefer using
the night-net in autumn; this bird is also caught in the water-trap in August
and September.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attractive Qualities.</span>&mdash;The song of the titlark, though short, and
composed of only three strains mixed with shakes and trills, is nevertheless
very pleasing. It sings from the end of March to July, either from
the top of a tree, where it is perched, or when rising perpendicularly in the
air, where it remains a few minutes and then quietly descends, almost
always to the same place. As it alights it repeats several times &#8220;<i>tzia,
tzia, tzia</i>.&#8221; In the house it begins to sing a month earlier. It pleases
also by its pretty ways; its step is somewhat grave, and the tail is in perpetual
motion: it is always very clean and trim.</p></div>

<h4>THE FIELD PIPIT.</h4>

<p class="center">Anthus campestris, <span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>; La Spipolette, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Die Brachpieper,
<span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> figure it is more slender than the sky-lark; the plumage
resembles that of the crested lark, and the form that of the
titlark. Its length is six inches and a half. The beak is strong
and long, the line above the eyes distinctly marked, the breast
yellowish white, with but few rays or lines. In summer it
frequents marshy woods, in autumn the edges of the fields,
high roads, and meadows, where it may be easily caught with
the night-net. Its only known song is its constant cry &#8220;<i>tsirru</i>&#8221;
and &#8220;<i>datsida</i>&#8221; while revolving in the air. It departs in September
and returns in April. Its food is the same as that of
the titlark; it also requires the same treatment when in confinement
if it should be wished to keep it, but it has no qualities
to make this desirable.</p>

<hr />

<h4>THE SHORE LARK.</h4>

<p class="center">Alauda alpestris, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; Alouette Haussecol noir, ou Alouette de Virginie,
<span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Die Berglerche, <span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> species is seven inches long, rather stronger than the
field pipit, and has the same plumage on the upper part of the
body; but the throat is light yellow, as well as the rest of the
under part of the neck, over which and the top of the breast
passes a black band, which in the lower part is shaped like a
horse-shoe. The beak, feet, and claws, are black.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><img src="images/i_207.png" alt="SHORE LARK." title="" height="289" width="500" />
<p class="caption">SHORE LARK.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Observations.</span>&mdash;This species properly inhabits the north as well of Europe
as of America, as far as Virginia; but in the winter it appears in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>Germany, where it may be seen by the road side picking for its food the
undigested grains in horse-dung. It perches like the wood-lark. It is
caught in the southern parts of Thuringia with lime twigs, or nets, at its
return in March, when there has happened a heavy fall of snow; but at
such times it is so thin and so weak for want of food as scarcely to have
strength to eat what is offered to it. It may, no doubt, be preserved in
confinement by treating it like other larks, but of this I have no experience,
never having been able to procure a single living individual of this
species, which also prevents my speaking of its song.</p></div>

<h4>THE CALANDRA LARK.</h4>

<p class="center">Alauda Calandra, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; La Calandre, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Die Kalander, <span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Larger</span> than the common lark, the Calandra is also furnished
with a shorter and stronger beak, which enables it to
shell its grain; in other respects the plumage, the form, and
manners, are the same, the only difference being a very distinct
and apparent spot on the lower part of the neck. The male is
distinguished by being larger and blacker round the neck; the
female has a very narrow collar, and sometimes none at all;
some individuals, old ones doubtless, have a large black mark
at the top of the breast. The tail is black, according to Linn&aelig;us,
while in the preceding it is brown.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Habitation.</span>&mdash;It appears that this species has much resemblance to the
preceding; but it does not inhabit the North; it is found in Syria, Italy,
Sardinia, and Provence: it is also said to frequent Carolina, in America.</p>

<p>In confinement it must be furnished with a long cage, the top made of
linen, because it hops and jumps about a great deal, especially at first. It
must be fed like the other larks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Breeding.</span>&mdash;It builds on the ground like the sky-lark, and lays four or
five eggs. In order to have calandras which sing well, they must be bred
up from the nest, and be fed in the same manner as the young of the sky-lark
species; this is how they breed them in Provence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mode of Taking.</span>&mdash;In the countries where it is found, the plan consists
in spreading a net near the water where it drinks; this method is considered
the best.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attractive Qualities.</span>&mdash;Its song is so admired in Italy, that &#8220;to sing
like a calandra&#8221; is a common expression for to &#8220;sing well.&#8221; It also
possesses the talent of imitating, like the sky-lark, the songs of many birds,
such as the goldfinch, the linnet, the canary, and even the chirp of young
chickens, the cry of the cat, in short, all sounds adapted to its organs, and
which may be acquired when they are flexible.</p></div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;"><img src="images/i_210.png" alt="THE STARLING." title="" height="265" width="250" /></div>

<h4>THE STARLING.</h4>

<p class="center">Sturnus vulgaris, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; L&#8217;Ltourneau, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Der gemeine Staar,
<span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> length of this bird is eight inches and a half, two and
a half of which belong to the tail, and one to the beak, which
is awl-shaped, angular, flattish, and rather blunt, yellow,
brown towards the end, and the tip blue. The iris is nut-brown;
the claws an inch long, are deep flesh-coloured. All
the plumage is of a blackish hue, changing to purple towards
the front of the body, and to green towards the hind part, and
on the wing-coverts. The old males are darker, having no
white tips to the feathers of the head, cheeks, throat, or belly.</p>

<p>The beak of the female is rather brown than yellow; the
light spots on the head, neck, and breast, are larger, and the
edge of the feathers is wider, which gives it a lighter and more
speckled appearance.</p>

<p>The starling, like all other species, has its varieties: such
are the white, the streaked or variegated, the white-headed,
that whose body is white with a black head, and the ash gray.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Habitation.</span>&mdash;When wild the starling is found all over the old world.
It prefers forests and little thickets, surrounded by fields and meadows;
it is often seen, especially in spring, on towers, steeples, and churches;
but it is never found either in high mountains or ridges. In our climate,
it departs, in October, in great flights for the south, and returns in like
manner in the beginning of March. During the journey, these birds pass
the night among the rushes, where, on the least alarm, they make a
great tumult.</p>

<p>In confinement it would be very amusing to let them run free; but let
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>them be ever so neat themselves, they would render the room dirty.
When caged, they must be furnished with a cage at least two feet long,
and one and a half both in height and width. Very restless and always
in motion, they require sufficient space to take exercise and keep their
plumage uninjured.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Food.</span>&mdash;When wild they eat not only caterpillars, snails, worms,
insects, and the flies which torment the cattle in the field; but also
cherries, grapes, berries of all sorts, and different sorts of grain, as millet
and hemp seed.</p>

<p>In confinement they eat meat, worms, bread, cheese, the universal paste,
indeed, any food, provided it is not sour. When first caught, they are
supplied with earth and meal-worms, and they soon become as tame as if
they had been brought up from the nest; but, as there is no rule without
exceptions, we sometimes meet with individuals which obstinately refuse
to eat, whatever pains may be taken to induce them, and which die of
hunger. This bird delights in bathing often, it must therefore never be
left without fresh water in a proper vessel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Breeding.</span>&mdash;The starling builds in the holes of trees, and even in boxes,
or pots with long necks, suspended to trees, or under the roof, or in
pigeon-houses. Its simple nest is composed of dry leaves, hay, and
feathers. Like the swallow it returns to the same nest every year, only
taking care to clean it out. It lays twice in the year, seven eggs each
time, whose colour is ashy green. The young, before moulting, are of
rather a yellowish soot colour, than pure black. The beak is dark
brown; those which are bred from the nest, and which are easily reared
on white bread soaked in milk, repeat the airs they are taught in a stronger
and more distinct manner than bullfinches and linnets. They can, indeed,
repeat a succession of couplets without changing or mixing them. In
Voigtlande, the peasants use the starling like domestic pigeons; they eat
the young, which they take before they can fly; by this means they
obtain three broods, but they do not touch the last, both in order not to
discourage and drive away the father and mother, and not to diminish this
branch of economy.</p>

<p>Starlings have been seen to build in dwelling-houses, in an earthen vase
with a long neck, appropriated to the purpose<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">64</a>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diseases.</span>&mdash;I know none peculiar to them. These birds will live ten
or twelve years in confinement.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mode of Taking.</span>&mdash;It is principally in autumn, and in places filled with
reeds, that the bird-catchers take great numbers of starlings in nets
prepared for the purpose. They may also be procured by means of an
osier fish-net, placed among the reeds, which they frequent in the evening,
and baited with cherries. Though this means is limited, as many as a
hundred have been procured by it in one night.</p>

<p>In Thuringia it is never attempted to catch them for the house except
in the month of March, when snow falls after their arrival. For this
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>purpose limed twigs are put in places cleared from snow, and beside
swampy ditches, with some earth-worms for a snare, into which they fall
as easily as chickens.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attractive Qualities.</span>&mdash;The starling becomes wonderfully familiar
in the house; as docile and cunning as a dog, he is always gay, wakeful,
soon knows all the inhabitants of the house, remarks their motions and
air, and adapts himself to their humours. In his solemn tottering step,
he appears to go stupidly forward; but nothing escapes his eye. He
learns to pronounce words without having his tongue cut, which proves
the uselessness of this cruel operation. He repeats correctly the airs
which are taught him, as does also the female, imitates the cries of men
and animals, and the songs of all the birds in the room with him. It
must be owned that his acquirements are very uncertain: he forgets as
fast as he learns, or he mixes up the old and new in utter confusion;
therefore, if it is wished to teach him an air, or to pronounce some words
clearly and distinctly, it is absolutely necessary to separate him from other
birds and animals, in a room where he can hear nothing. Not only are
the young susceptible of these instructions, the oldest even show the
most astonishing docility.</p></div>

<h4>THE BOHEMIAN CHATTERER.</h4>

<p class="center">Ampelis garrulus, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; Le Jaseur de Boh&egrave;me, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Der gemeine
Seidenschwanz, <span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> length of this bird is eight inches, one and a quarter of
which belong to the tail. The beak is three quarters of an
inch long, black, short, straight, arched above, and large at
the base, forming a large opening when the mandibles are
separated; the iris is brown; the shanks nearly an inch high,
and black. The whole body is covered with soft silky feathers;
those at the top of the head are long, and rise in a crest; the
head and the rest of the upper part of the body are of a reddish
ash-colour, changing to gray at the rump; the middle coverts
are dark ash gray, with the ends white also, besides which, the
shaft of many has a horny tip, shining and red, like a little
oval bit of sealing-wax. The female has at most but five of
these waxen tips to each wing, while the male has from five to
nine; the tail is black, terminated with primrose yellow; very
old males have also upon it narrow red wax tips.</p>

<p>In the female, the black spot on the throat is smaller; the
yellow at the end of the tail is also narrower and paler; the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
tips of the wings are of a yellowish white; lastly, the horny
appendages are small, and often they do not appear at all.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Habitation.</span>&mdash;When wild it does not build in Germany, but within the
Arctic circle; it is found in Thuringia only in the winter, and if the season
is mild in very small numbers, the greater portion remaining in the north;
but in severe cold it advances farther south. In moderate seasons it is
found in great flights in the skirts of the forests throughout the greater part
of Germany and Bohemia.</p>

<p>In confinement, it is generally kept in a grated corner, where it may run
about freely with the other birds which are also placed there, taking care
to keep it at a distance from the stove, the heat of which is so distressing
that it opens its beak and breathes with difficulty; this proves that a warm
climate is not congenial to the bird. If kept in a cage, it requires one as
large as the thrush; and, as it is a very dirty bird, the bottom must be
regularly covered with a sufficient quantity of sand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Food.</span>&mdash;When wild we see it in the spring eating, like thrushes, all sorts
of flies and other insects; in autumn and winter different kinds of berries;
and, in times of need, the buds and sprouts of the beech, maple, and various
fruit trees.</p>

<p>In confinement the two universal pastes appear delicacies to it; and it
is even satisfied with bran steeped in water. It swallows every thing voraciously,
and refuses nothing eatable, such as potatoes, cabbage, salad, fruits
of all sorts, and especially white bread. It likes to bathe, or rather to
sprinkle itself with water, for it does not wet itself so much as other birds.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mode of Taking.</span>&mdash;It is taken in nooses, to which berries are fixed,
which, for this purpose, should always be kept in store till February; attracted
by the bait it falls into the snare. It appears to be frightened at
nothing, for it flies into nets and traps, though it sees its companions caught
and hanging, and uttering cries of distress and fear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attractive Qualities.</span>&mdash;Nothing but its beauty and scarcity can render
the possession of it desirable; for it is a stupid, lazy bird. During the
ten or twelve years that it can exist in confinement, and on very meagre
food, it does nothing but eat and repose for digestion. If hunger induces it
to move, its step is awkward, and its jumps so clumsy as to be disagreeable
to the eye. Its song consists only of weak and uncertain whistling, a little
resembling the thrush, but not so loud. While singing, it moves the crest
up and down, but hardly moves the throat. If this warbling is somewhat
unmusical, it has the merit of continuing throughout every season of the
year. When the Bohemian chatterer is angry, which happens sometimes
near the common feeding-trough, it knocks very violently with its beak.
It is easily tamed, but is agreeable only by its beautiful colours, for it is
very dirty. It is the greatest eater among birds that I know, being able to
devour in a day a quantity of food equal to its own weight. It consequently
passes hardly half digested, and, what is very disgusting, it is seen,
like the ostrich, to eat again this excrement, if it is destitute of fresh food.
I have observed it in this way swallow three times juniper berries which
I had given it. In consequence of this voraciousness it must be cleaned
very often to be kept sweet.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> bird resembles the starling in size, but the head is
more pointed, and the body, in general, larger, while the
wings and tail are shorter, the tail being only one inch and a
quarter long, and the ends of the wings cover a fourth part of
it; the beak is three quarters of an inch long, narrow, flattish
at the sides, raised in the middle, sharp and black; the narrow
nostrils are almost entirely closed by a membrane; the iris is
light brown; the shanks are an inch high, and of a dark
brown, and have the four toes united together; the head and
upper part of the neck are of a dusky rust brown; the rest of
the upper part of the body is black, with an ashy gray tint;
the quill-feathers and tail are blackish; the neck to half-way
down the breast is pure white; the rest of the breast is deep
maroon, which shades into the black of the belly.</p>

<p>In the female the head and upper part of the neck are
lighter, and the white of the breast is not so pure as in the male.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Habitation.</span>&mdash;When wild it frequents by preference the banks of rivers
and streams in mountainous countries, and remains all the year near those
whose waters flow from springs which never freeze.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span></p>

<p>In confinement it has a cage like the thrush, unless it is by preference
allowed to run about the room.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Food.</span>&mdash;When wild it feeds upon aquatic insects, worms, and even small
fish, which it is said to seize by diving.</p>

<p>In confinement it becomes insensibly accustomed to one of the universal
pastes, by at first giving it worms, and the eggs of ants and flies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Breeding.</span>&mdash;The female lays from four to six eggs in a rather large nest,
which she places in a crack of the rocks at the edge of the water, or in
dikes under mill-dams, the wooden gutters of mills, or between the wings
of old water-wheels which are not in use. The young may be reared on
meal-worms, ants&#8217; eggs, and white bread soaked in milk. It is just as
well not to take them till they are ready to fly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mode of Taking.</span>&mdash;Each pair has a chosen spot, which it seldom leaves:
and they are generally seen there either on a trough, a stone, dike, or a
bush growing near; by fixing close to these places limed twigs, to which
are fastened worms, which writhe about and attract attention, it is very
easy to catch them.</p>

<p>As soon as one of these birds is caught and caged, he must be put in a
quiet place, be fed with earth and meal-worms, and thus be gradually accustomed
to the common food.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attractive Qualities.</span>&mdash;The song of the dipper is not disagreeable;
he has, indeed, some very sonorous strains, which in the distance and
during winter have a very good effect. He also sings in the night.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> is the largest of our thrushes, being in length eleven
inches, three and a half of which belong to the tail. The beak
is one inch in length, sharp, dark brown, with the lower base

of the mountains, and prefers those of fir to oak and beech. In Thuringia
it is a bird of passage, disappearing in December and returning in the
month of February, provided the weather is fine<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">65</a>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span></p>

<p>In confinement it is common to assign it a grated corner of the room
unless a cage is preferred, which must be at least three feet and a half
long, and nearly as many high, a size necessary for it to take the exercise
suited to its vivacity and petulance, without injuring its feathers. It would
be still better if it could be allowed, as other birds of its size, an aviary or
room to itself, where its copious excrements would be less troublesome.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Food.</span>&mdash;When wild it feeds on insects and earth-worms, which it finds
in abundance in fields and swamps during the spring and summer; in
autumn and winter berries of all sorts make a great addition.</p>

<p>In confinement it is not dainty. The two universal pastes are very well
liked, but it will put up with plain oatmeal, or even bran moistened with
water. It is thus that our bird-fanciers feed it throughout the year, as well
as many other large birds caught in traps, which they are obliged to keep
as a lure for the snare. It is true, that if this meagre diet is sufficient to
keep it alive, it will hardly serve to enliven it and make it sing; for this
purpose it must be better fed, with bread and milk, meat, and other dishes
served at table, none of which it refuses; and it must also be allowed to
bathe, since nothing does it more good, or enlivens it so much.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Breeding.</span>&mdash;Its nest, which it places higher or lower in the trees of the
forest, is formed at bottom of herb-stalks and lichens, in the middle of
earth, and in the interior of mosses, fine roots and hay: it lays twice a
year, generally each time four greenish white eggs, a little speckled with
violet and maroon. The young birds are gray above and very much spotted
under, with a wide edge of rusty yellow on the wing feathers. Much
less docile and susceptible of instruction than the blackbird, they hardly
remember any little thing which they hear continually, but they become
so familiar as to sing without difficulty on the hand. They are fed with
white bread soaked in boiled milk.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diseases.</span>&mdash;The commonest disorders of this bird, are an obstruction of
the rump gland, constipation, and atrophy<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">66</a>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mode of Taking.</span>&mdash;These birds are taken in autumn with nets and
snares, with berries for the bait, and they are caught in great numbers.
They may also be taken in February, by placing under the trees on which
the mistleto grows, perches with limed twigs. They may also be caught
in the water-traps at sunset. Those which are yellowish under the body,
being males, are chosen for confinement. During the first days of captivity,
they are savage, sulky, and often refuse to eat, so that many perish in this
way; those which are saved soon repay the trouble by their songs and
familiarity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attractive Qualities.</span>&mdash;Perched on the top of a tree in the woods,
the missel thrush begins, in the month of February, to utter his melancholy
but musical warblings, consisting of five or six broken strains, and continues
singing for four or five months. As his song is too loud for the sitting-room,
this bird should be placed in a large hall, or his cage should be hung
outside a window. He lives in captivity from ten to twelve years. His
call very much resembles &#8220;<i>iis, r, r, r</i>.&#8221;</p></div>

<h4>THE SONG THRUSH.</h4>

<p class="center">Turdus musicus, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; La Grive, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Die Singdrossel, <span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> might, with Brisson, name this bird the <i>small missel
thrush</i>, so much does it resemble the preceding in form,
plumage, abode, manners, and gait. Its length is only eight
inches and a half, three and a half of which belong to the tail.
The beak is three quarters of an inch, horn brown, the under
part yellowish at the base and yellow within; the iris is nut
brown; the shanks are an inch high, and of a dingy lead-colour.
All the upper part of the body is olive brown; the throat is
yellowish white, with a black line on each side; the sides of
the neck and breast are of a pale reddish white, variegated with
dark brown spots, shaped liked a heart reversed; the belly is
white, and covered with more oval spots.</p>

<p>In the female the two black lines on the throat are narrower,
the breast is lighter, and of a plain yellowish white, and the
reddish spots on the wing-coverts are smaller. These slight
differences make it desirable for those whose eye is not accustomed
to them, to have both sexes before them, if they wish to
learn to distinguish them.</p>

<p>The white variety, that with a white head, the streaked, and
the ash-coloured, are not very rare.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Habitation.</span>&mdash;When wild this species is spread all over Europe, frequenting
woods near streams and meadows. As soon as the autumnal fogs
appear, they collect in large flights to seek a warmer climate<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">67</a>. The principal
time of passage is from the 15th of September to the 15th of October,
and of return about the middle or end of March; each pair then returns to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>its own district, and the male warbles his hymn to spring from the same
tree where he had sung it the preceding year.</p>

<p>In confinement this bird is lodged like the missel thrush, and is much
more worthy of being kept, as its voice is more beautiful, its song is more
varied, and being smaller it makes less dirt.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Food.</span>&mdash;When wild it lives on insects and berries, like the preceding.</p>

<p>In confinement, oatmeal moistened with milk is a very good food; and
it requires also a great deal of fresh water, as well for bathing as drinking.
When taken old it is often very difficult to induce these birds to eat, and
the greater number die in consequence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Breeding.</span>&mdash;This species generally builds on the lower branches of trees;
the nest being pretty large, and formed of moss mixed with earth or cow-dung.
The hen lays twice a year, from three to six green eggs, speckled
with large and small dark brown spots. The first brood is ready to fly by
the end of April. The upper part of the body in the young ones is speckled
with white. By taking them from the nest when half-grown they may be
easily reared on white bread soaked in boiled milk; and they are easily
taught to perform airs. As this thrush builds by preference in the neighbourhood
of water, the nest may be easily found by seeking it in the woods
beside a stream, and near it the male will be heard singing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mode of Taking.</span>&mdash;This is the same as for the preceding species and the
three which follow; of all the birds for which snares are laid, those for the
thrush are most successful. A perch with a limed twig is the best method
for catching a fine-toned male. In September and October these birds may
also be caught in the water traps, where they repair at sunrise and sunset,
and sometimes so late that they cannot be seen, and the ear is the only
guide. When they enter the water haste must be avoided, because they
like to bathe in company, and assemble sometimes to the number of ten or
twelve at once, by means of a particular call. The first which finds a convenient
stream, and wishes to go to it, cries in a tone of surprise or joy,
&#8220;<i>sik, sik, sik, siki, tsac, tsac, tsac</i>;&#8221; immediately all in the neighbourhood
reply together, and repair to the place: they enter the bath however
with much circumspection, and seldom venture till they have seen a red-breast
bathe without danger; but the first which ventures is soon followed
by the others, which begin to quarrel if the place is not large enough for all
the bathers. In order to attract them, it is a good plan to have a tame bird
running and fluttering on the banks of the stream.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attractive Qualities.</span>&mdash;The song thrush is the great charm of our
woods, which it enlivens by the beauty of its song. The rival of the
nightingale, it announces in varied accents the return of spring, and continues
its delightful notes during all the summer months, particularly at
morning and evening twilight. It is to procure this gratification in his
dwelling that the bird-fancier rears it, and deprives it of its liberty; and
he thus enjoys the pleasures of the woods in the midst of the city. With
care and properly varied food it may be preserved in captivity five or six
years.</p></div>

<h4>THE FIELDFARE.</h4>

<p class="center">Turdus pilaris, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; La Litorne, ou La Tourdelle, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Die Wachholderdrossel,
<span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> bird is in size between the two preceding, its length
being ten inches, of which the tail occupies four. The beak is
an inch long, blackish at the point, otherwise yellow, as well
as the opening of the throat and the tongue. The iris is dark
brown. The shanks, an inch and a quarter high, are deep
brown; the top of the head and neck, the cheeks, the bottom
of the back, and the rump, are ash gray, with some blackish
spots at the top of the head; a white line passes above the
eyes; the back is rust brown; the throat and half the breast
are rusty yellow, strewed with black heart-shaped spots; the
rest of the under part of the body is white, with blackish
heart-shaped spots on the sides, and longer ones towards the
vent and tail.</p>

<p>In the female the upper part of the beak is browner, the
head and rump of a paler gray, the throat whitish, the back
dingy rust colour, and the feet deep brown.</p>

<p>Of this species there are many varieties, the white, the
spotted, the white headed, and the like.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Habitation.</span>&mdash;When wild this species spreads not only all over Europe,
but also over Syria and Siberia. In the summer it remains in the northern
regions, where it builds in pine forests. It arrives in Germany and England
in prodigious flights in November, and passes the winter in places producing
the juniper; its return northward takes place in the first fine days
of spring.</p>

<p>In confinement it is treated like the missel thrush, but it is generally
only kept as a decoy bird. Heat being injurious, it is kept as far as possible
from the stove.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Food.</span>&mdash;When wild it feeds like the two preceding species.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span></p>

<p>In confinement it is fed in the same way; raw carrots grated with bread
is added, which the others like also.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mode of Taking.</span>&mdash;The same as in the two preceding species.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attractive Qualities.</span>&mdash;Its song is a mere harsh disagreeable warble.
I should not have introduced it among cage birds if the lovers of bird-catching
did not in winter require its call when pursuing its species.</p></div>

<hr />

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;"><img src="images/i_220.png" alt="THE REDWING." title="" height="213" width="250" /></div>

<h4>THE REDWING.</h4>

<p class="center">Turdus iliacus, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; Le Mauvis, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Die Rothdrossel, <span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> species is smaller than the song thrush, and has much
resemblance to the fieldfare. Its length is eight inches, of
which the tail occupies three and a quarter. The beak is
nearly an inch long, blackish, and yellow only at the base and
angles of the lower mandible; the iris is nut-brown. The
shanks are an inch high, and light gray; the feet are yellow;
the head, the upper part of the neck, the back, the rump, and
the small coverts of the wings, are olive brown. The plumage
is more brilliant than that of other thrushes, and the orange-hue
under the wings, which has procured it the name of the
redwing thrush, will always sufficiently distinguish this from
those of the same genus.</p>

<p>The female is altogether lighter coloured. The line of the
eyes is almost white; the spots on the sides of the neck light
yellow; the under part of the body is white, the neck alone
appearing yellowish; the spots on the breast are grayish brown,
and there are none about the vent. This species also has its
varieties, as white, streaked, and the like.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Habitation.</span>&mdash;When wild it inhabits the north of Europe; it goes to
the south only towards the end of October, and returns at the end of
March or beginning of April.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span></p>

<p>In confinement the redwing is treated like the preceding; but it is not
much valued, as its song is in no respect agreeable. It always requires
fresh water and but little warmth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Food, Mode of Taking, Diseases.</span>&mdash;The same as in the preceding species.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attractive Qualities.</span>&mdash;The song of the male is as unmelodious as
that of the fieldfare. These birds make a great noise when they are collected
in large flights upon the alders, in March and April, but their warbling
hardly deserves the name of song. I have known but one which
succeeded in imitating, though very indifferently, the notes of the song
thrush and some loud tones of the nightingale. It is not therefore their
song which will gain these birds a place in the house; but they may please
by their familiarity, their patience, their easy motions, and the readiness
with which they obey orders. Bird catchers keep them principally as decoy
birds. They are good eating.</p></div>

<h4>THE ROSE OUZEL.</h4>

<p class="center">Turdus roseus, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; Le Merle Couleur de Rose, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Die Rosenfarbigedrossel,
<span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> is a bird which from its beauty certainly merits a
place in this work. Its length is nearly eight inches, of which
the tail measures three, and the beak one. This latter is
black, sometimes lead-coloured, from the base to the middle,
and flesh or rose-coloured from the middle to the point; the
iris is whitish; the shanks are fourteen lines high, lighter or
darker flesh-coloured; the claws are blackish. The head,
neck, and throat, are black, with the tips of the feathers white,
very much like the starling, and changeable into green, blue,
and purple; the feathers at the top of the head are long and
narrow, and rise elegantly into a crest; the back, the rump,
the shoulders, the breast, the belly, and the sides, are of a
brighter or paler rose-colour, according to the age and season.</p>

<p>The female differs from the male only in being less highly
and brilliantly coloured.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Habitation.</span>&mdash;When wild these birds are to be met with in many parts
of Europe and Asia. The inhabitants of Aleppo and the neighbourhood
see with pleasure the arrival of large flights of them, in the months of
July and August, to extirpate the clouds of locusts which then ravage the
country. Great numbers are also seen in spring on the banks of the Don
and Irtish, where they build and find abundance of food; also on the
shores of the Caspian and the banks of the Wolga. In Europe they
appear in Sweden as far as Lapland, in England, in Germany, in Switzerland,
and France: rare indeed in all these countries, but least so in Italy.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span></p>

<p>In confinement this bird is kept in a cage of the same size as the
blackbird&#8217;d.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Food.</span>&mdash;When wild this bird appears to subsist entirely on insects.</p>

<p>In confinement it would doubtless thrive very well on the food which
is given to the blackbird, which will be mentioned hereafter. It is better,
however, to study it a little, and find out what suits it best.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Breeding.</span>&mdash;It builds among rocks; but its nest has not yet been
discovered in Europe, though some circumstances indicate that it propagates
there. In 1784, in the duchy of Altenburg, three young ones
were killed, but just out of the nest, and which consequently could not
have come from far. This fact should excite the attention and vigilance of
zealous observers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Modes of Taking.</span>&mdash;Skilful bird-catchers will soon discover the means
of catching the bird: snares and limed twigs, with grasshoppers and other
living and moving insects for bait, will probably accomplish this end. It
would be hazardous to shoot the birds in the hope of wounding them but
slightly, as is sometimes done with other birds, which soon recover, and
remain tame, if, during their recovery, they have been well treated.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Observations.</span>&mdash;A sportsman discovered, in 1794, in the environs of
Meiningen, in Suabia, a flight of eight or ten rose ouzels, moving leisurely
from south-west to north-east, and passing from one cherry-tree to another.
He fired on these birds, only one fell, which was fortunately very slightly
wounded, so that it soon quite recovered. Being immediately carried to
M. Von Wachter, the rector of Frickenhausen, this clergyman took the
greatest care of it; he gave it a spacious cage, and found that barley-meal
moistened with milk was as wholesome as agreeable to it. His kindness
tamed it in a short time so far that it would come and take from his hand
the insects which he offered to it. It soon sang also, but its warbling
consisted at first of but a few harsh sounds, pretty well connected however,
and this became at length more clear and smooth. Connoisseurs in the
songs of birds discover in this song a mixture of many others; one of
these connoisseurs, who had not discovered the bird, but heard its voice,
thought he was listening to a concert of two starlings, two goldfinches, and
perhaps a siskin; and when he saw that it was a single bird, he could not
conceive how all this music proceeded from the same throat. This bird
was still alive in 1802, and the delight of its possessor.</p></div>

<h4>THE BLACKBIRD.</h4>

<p class="center">Turdus merula, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; Le Merle, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Die Schwarzdrossel, <span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> species, the most docile of its genus, is nine inches and
a half long, four of which belong to the tail. The beak is an
inch long, and orange yellow; the iris is dark brown; the
shanks are an inch high, and black. The whole plumage is of
a pure velvety black; the eyelids alone are orange.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span></p>

<p>The female is of a brownish black, with the breast of a
reddish hue, and the belly grayish; the throat is spotted with
dark and light brown. It is also rather larger than the male,
which has led some persons who were not well acquainted with
it to make another species of it.</p>

<p>The white variety is very well known; there is besides the
streaked, the black with a white head, and the pearl gray.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Habitation.</span>&mdash;When wild the blackbird is found all over the old world,
as well as in Germany; it is the only species of its genus which does not
migrate thence.</p></div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><img src="images/i_223.png" alt="CATO&#8217;O BLACKBIRD&#8217;D CAGE." title="" height="532" width="500" />
<p class="caption">CATO&#8217;O BLACKBIRD&#8217;D CAGE</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>In confinement it is kept in a large cage; it is better to keep it separate
because, whether from spite or jealousy, it is often inclined, like the tits,
to pursue and kill its little companions of the aviary or room.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Food.</span>&mdash;When wild the blackbird eats berries, and, in winter, when
insects are scarce, he seeks them near warm springs.</p>

<p>In confinement he is satisfied with the first universal paste, but he also
eats bread, meat, and anything which comes to table, such as a bit of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>apple. More delicate than the song thrush, he would not digest mere
bran and water. He delights in bathing often, and should therefore be
furnished with the means for so doing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Breeding.</span>&mdash;As the blackbird does not travel he pairs early in the
spring, and the first young are hatched by the end of March. The nest,
placed in a thick bush, or in a heap of boughs, is formed on the outside of
stalks, then of moss and mud and lined in the inside with fine hay, hair,
and wool. The female lays three times a year, from four to six eggs, of a
greenish gray, spotted and streaked with light brown; when the young are
hatched the males are always darker than the females, therefore bird-catchers
can never be mistaken when they take the former and leave the
latter. They are easily reared on white bread soaked in boiled milk, a
little raw beef, and worms dipped in water. It is better to take them
from the nest when the quills of the feathers are just beginning to
develop, because, having then no idea of their natural song, they will
retain more perfectly and distinctly the airs which may be taught them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diseases.</span>&mdash;An obstruction in the rump gland is their most common
disorder, and must be treated in the manner described in the Introduction.
It would doubtless be prevented by never omitting to furnish the means of
bathing. With care, and a proper variety of food, this bird will live in
confinement ten or twelve years.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Method of Catching.</span>&mdash;Timid and distrustful, the blackbird seldom
enters the area or barn-floor trap, but it is easily caught in the winter
with a noose or springe, by using service berries for a bait. It sometimes
falls into the large traps set for tits, when the berries are spread over the
bottom; limed twigs put with the berries in a place cleared from the
snow, will catch many also; it also goes to the water-trap, but generally at
night-fall. Its call is &#8220;<i>tsizirr, tak, tak</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attractive Qualities.</span>&mdash;The natural song of the blackbird is not
destitute of melody; but it is broken by noisy tones, and is agreeable
only in the open country. When wild it sings only from March to July;
but when caged, during the whole year, except when moulting. Its voice
is so strong and clear, that in a city it may be heard from one end of a
long street to the other. Its memory is so good, that it retains, without
mixing them, several airs at once, and it will even repeat little sentences.
It is a great favourite with the lovers of a plaintive, clear, and musical
song, and may, in these respects, be preferred to the bullfinch, whose
voice is softer, more flute-like, but also more melancholy. The price of
these two birds, if well taught, is about the same.</p></div>

<h4>THE RING BLACKBIRD.</h4>

<p class="center">Turdus torquatus, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; Merle &agrave; Plastron blanc, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Die Ringdrossel,
<span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> bird is larger than the common blackbird, being in
length ten inches and a half, four of which belong to the tail.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
The beak is an inch long, raven gray, yellowish white at the
base of the lower mandible, and yellow at the angles as well
as inside: the iris is chestnut brown; the shanks dark brown,
and fourteen lines high; the upper part of the body is black;
and it is the principal colour of the under part also; but the
feathers of the belly and the coverts of the wings are edged
with white; the quill-feathers, and the outside feathers of the
tail are grayish white; a white spot, tinged with red, and the
size of the finger, placed transversely on the breast, serves to
characterize the species, and gives it its name.</p>

<p>The female is of a brownish black; the transverse band on
the breast is narrower, and of a reddish ash-colour, shaded
with brown.</p>

<p>Those individuals which combine the brown colour of the
female with the pectoral band, large, and of a reddish white,
are young males; the others, in which it is scarcely discernible,
are young females.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Observations.</span>&mdash;Though the ring blackbird traverses the whole of Europe,
it builds only in the north<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">68</a>. It arrives in Germany and England
on the foggy days of the end of October and beginning of November. It
moves always in small flights, stopping generally in spots covered with
briers and juniper bushes, where it may be caught with a noose. Its food,
when free and in confinement, is the same as that of the common blackbird,
with which it has the most striking resemblance in its gait, the motion
of its wings and tail, and its call, &#8220;<i>tak</i>.&#8221; Its voice, though hoarser
and deeper, is nevertheless more harmonious and agreeable. It is so weak
that a red-breast may overpower it. It continues singing at all times,
except when moulting. It will live in confinement from six to ten years.</p></div>

Germany<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">69</a>. Though its principal characteristics place it in
the genus of the blackbird, it has more resemblance to the
starling, both in its manners and gait, which are varied and
agreeable. Its length is seven inches and a half, two and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>three quarters of which belong to the tail. The beak, an inch
long, and the shanks, an inch and a quarter high, are black.
The head and neck are grayish blue, or ash blue, lighter in
the old, and darker in the young birds; the top of the back is
dark brown, often varying to a lighter brown, the middle a fine
white; the rump, of a dark brown, has the feathers tipped
with white; the breast is dark orange, the belly the same;
but, according to the season, more or less spotted and undulated
with white.</p>

<p>The female is dark brown on the upper part of the body,
with edges of whitish gray to the feathers; those of the rump
are rust-colour, with the same gray edge; the chin is white;
the throat brown; the under part of the neck, and the whole
under part of the body, of a dirty orange, with waving lines of
brown and white; the tail is paler than that of the male, and
the feet are dark brown.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Habitation.</span>&mdash;When wild it is found in the south of Europe and Germany,
in Austria, and the Tyrol. In France, in Bugey, and more to the
south; and especially in the Alps and Pyrenees, frequenting rocks or old
ruined castles. In its migrations it visits bare rocky mountains, searching
for insects which take refuge among the stones. Its departure is in September
and its return in March.</p>

<p>In confinement it is furnished with a cage larger than that of the nightingale.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Food.</span>&mdash;When wild it appears to live entirely on insects.</p>

<p>In confinement it is fed like the nightingale; but with every care it
cannot long be preserved.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Breeding.</span>&mdash;The female builds her nest in an almost inaccessible crevice
of the rocks, and lays five eggs. As the young are very susceptible
of instruction, they are readily brought up when they can be obtained<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">70</a>;
they are fed and treated like young nightingales.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mode of Taking.</span>&mdash;It is by fixing to the spots they frequent plenty of
limed twigs, with meal-worms attached to them; it is said that in the
Alps and Pyrenees they are caught with a bird-call.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attractive Qualities.</span>&mdash;It is considered one of the most agreeable
singers; and if caught young it soon acquires the songs of the other birds
of the chamber, learns to whistle tunes, and even, like the starling, to repeat
words. &#8220;It begins to sing,&#8221; says Buffon, &#8220;a little before dawn,
which it announces by noisy sounds. If its cage is approached during the
night with a candle, it begins to sing; and when, during the day, it does
not sing, it appears to be practising in an under tone, and preparing new
songs.&#8221;</p></div>

<h4>THE SOLITARY THRUSH.</h4>

<p class="center">Turdus solitarius, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; Le Merle solitaire, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Die Einsame
Drossel, <span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> bird is eight inches and a half long, three of which
belong to the tail. The beak is an inch and a quarter long,
rather crooked at the point, dark brown without, and yellowish
within; the iris is orange. The feet are thirteen lines
high, and brown. The whole plumage is brown studded with
little white spots, with a faint tint of blue on the sides of the
head, the throat, under the body, on the breast and coverts of
the wings; the rump is brown without spots, and the tail
blackish.</p>

<p>The female differs from the male in having the little spots
of a dirty yellow, and more numerous on the breast than elsewhere,
and in being destitute of the blue tint; and finally, in
having the pen-feathers and the tail-feathers simply brown.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Habitation.</span>&mdash;When wild it seldom quits the mountains in the south
of Europe; in spring, however, it advances as far as Burgundy, and returns
in the end of August; it arrives, in the month of April, at the spot
where it generally passes the summer, and returns constantly every year to
the place where it first took up its abode. Two pairs are seldom found in
the same district. Except in the pairing season it is a solitary bird.</p>

<p>In confinement it is furnished with a cage like that of the blackbird.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Food.</span>&mdash;When wild it feeds on insects, berries, and grapes.</p>

<p>In confinement it is treated like the song thrush, adding ants&#8217; eggs and
meal-worms.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Breeding.</span>&mdash;The nest, made of blades of grass and feathers, is generally
placed at the top of a solitary chimney, or on the summit of an old castle,
or on the top of a large tree, generally near a steeple or high tower. The
female lays five or six eggs. The young ones, if taken from the nest soon
enough, are capable of instruction; the flexibility of the throat fitting it
either for tunes or words. They sing also by candle-light in the night. If
treated with care they live in confinement eight or ten years. From the
summit of a high tower or steeple the male utters for whole days the most
beautiful and pathetic song, accompanying it by flapping his wings, moving
his tail, and elevating the feathers of his head.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attractive Qualities.</span>&mdash;His beautiful voice is in great repute in all the
countries he inhabits; it is, indeed, very sweet and flute-like; his song,
though musical, is somewhat melancholy, as is usual with solitary birds;
many persons, however, are very fond of it. This bird, when tamed, fetches
a very high price at Milan, Constantinople, &amp;c. In some countries it is so
much respected that it is considered sacrilegious to kill it or destroy its
nest.</p></div>

<h4>THE BLUE THRUSH.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> bird is rather larger than the common blackbird, its
length being eight inches, three of which belong to the tail.
The beak, fourteen lines in length, is blackish, the iris dark
nut brown, the eyelids yellow; the shanks, thirteen lines in
height, are blackish; the whole plumage is of an ash blue, but
each feather has near its tip a transverse brown line, and the tip
itself is whitish. The individual birds vary in the depth of the
blue, according to their age and sex.</p>

<p>The female is generally more uniform in colour than the
male.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Habitation.</span>&mdash;When wild the blue thrush is found in the Archipelago,
in Dalmatia, Italy, Spain, and other southern countries, always among steep
rocks.</p>

<p>In confinement it is provided with a convenient cage, like the preceding.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Food.</span>&mdash;When wild it feeds on all sorts of insects.</p>

<p>In confinement it is fed like the nightingale.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Breeding.</span>&mdash;Like the rock thrush it builds among rocks, on ruined or
deserted towers, and the like. The young are reared in the same way as
those of the nightingale.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attractive Qualities.</span>&mdash;Its pretty plumage and fine voice do not constitute
its only attractions. It is very easily tamed, and is very capable of
instruction, and amuses much by its natural gait and habits, which very
much resemble those of the rock thrush.</p></div>

<hr />

<h4>THE REED THRUSH.</h4>

<p class="center">Turdus arundinaceus, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; La Rousserole, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Die Rohrdrossel,
<span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> bird has so much resemblance to the white-throats, as
to cause a hesitation whether it should be ranged with them or
with the thrush; but the form of the beak and feet, and
generally the whole colour of the body, are in favour of the
latter. The total length is at most eight inches, four and a
quarter of which belong to the tail, which is of a rounded
wedge-shape. The beak is ten lines in length, and strong,
flattish, brown at the point, yellowish at the base, and orange<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
on the inside; the iris is dark maroon. The shanks are an
inch high, strong, and brownish gray, blending into flesh-colour.
This bird is so like the nightingale, that if the tail
were reddish it would be mistaken for it. The top of the head
and neck are dark gray, with a light olive tint; a line of dusky
yellow extends above the eyes from the nostrils to the middle;
the cheeks are brownish gray; the back and the coverts of the
wings reddish gray, which becomes lighter, and passes at the
rump into pure rust-colour.</p>

<p>The female differs from the male only in being smaller,
rather darker on the upper, and lighter on the lower parts of
the body; the white of the throat is less extensive, and the
upper part of the head is tinged with red.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Habitation.</span>&mdash;When wild it is found all over Europe, with the exception
of the most northern parts; it is a stranger in those parts of Germany
only where there are neither lakes, ponds, nor stagnant rivers abounding
with rushes; for it is always on their banks and in large swamps that it
resides, and more frequently on the ground than in trees<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">71</a>.</p>

<p>In confinement it is provided with a nightingale&#8217;s cage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Food.</span>&mdash;When wild it feeds on aquatic insects, the enormous multitude
of which it seems intended to diminish. In order to catch these it is continually
seen climbing the stems of the rushes and reeds: it also eats
berries.</p>

<p>In confinement, hitherto, no food but that of the nightingale has succeeded
with it, and that even for only four or six months. It is soon attacked by
a disease which carries off great numbers of white-throats: the feathers
falling off without being renewed, the bird declines and dies of atrophy<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">72</a>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Breeding.</span>&mdash;The nest is found fastened with wool to the stems of the
rushes, or the branches of neighbouring bushes. On the outside it is
formed of moss and stubble, firmly mixed, and lined on the inside with fine
hay and hair. The eggs, five or six in number, are grayish white, spotted
with black. The young, before the first moulting, have the appearance of
a white-throat, with some dark spots on the breast. They are taken from
the nest and reared, like young nightingales, on ants&#8217; eggs; and if they are
placed near this winged Orpheus, they learn his song so well and so perfectly
that they become as excellent performers as their masters, with the
additional advantage of possessing a noise more flute-like and less shrill than
that of the nightingale.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mode of Taking.</span>&mdash;The great difficulty of catching this bird makes it
scarce in our rooms. The only means is to ascertain well the place it frequents,
then to scratch up the earth and throw upon it some meal-worms,
and cover the place with limed twigs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attractive Qualities.</span>&mdash;With a more beautiful and musical voice, its
song is also more varied than that of the song-thrush, without being so long,
so sustained, or so brilliant, as that of the nightingale, with which it most
deserves to be compared. Some of its couplets resemble those of the blackcap,
but broken, like those of the song-thrush. When caged it may be
much improved by imitation of the notes of the nightingale, which the
young easily copy. It is particularly in the morning and evening that the
reed-thrush utters his beautiful warblings. Not only is his throat then in
motion; his wings, his tail, and his whole body, are agitated as if to follow
the cadence and the measure.</p></div>

<h4>THE NIGHTINGALE.</h4>

<p class="center">Motacilla Luscinia, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; Le Rossignol, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Die Nachtigall, <span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> bird, whose plumage is very ordinary, is scarcely five
inches long, two and a half of which belong to the tail. But, in
confinement, when it is well fed, and especially when it has
been bred from the nest, it is commonly larger, reaching sometimes
the size of a lark. The straight beak is seven lines in
length, thin, with the two mandibles of nearly the same size, and
dark brown above, light gray below, flesh-coloured at the base,
and yellow within; the iris is brownish grey. The shanks,
three quarters of an inch high, are flesh-coloured; the upper
part of the body is brownish gray, tinted with rust-red, and in
very old birds is reddish ash-coloured.</p>

<p>Among individuals in confinement, some are lighter, others
darker. When placed in the windows of a large well-lighted
room, which is not exposed to smoke, they are in the upper
parts dark gray, or light brownish gray, and the feathers have a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
reddish edge; below they are white, and grayish on the sides.
But those which are shut up in small ill-lighted rooms, subject
to smoke, soon lose their colours, the upper part of the body
becoming dingy red, the under part grayish white, and the sides
brownish gray.</p>

<p>Those accustomed to birds distinguish the female at a glance.
Her shanks are not so high: she is not so erect; her head is
not so long and pointed, but rounder; her neck is shorter, and
more inclined back; her eye is smaller and less lively; and her
throat is not so white. Notwithstanding these characteristics,
no other than an experienced person could decide the sex unless
he had them both before him.</p>

<p>Nightingales so strongly resemble the female redstart, that
the latter is often caught and sold for a nightingale, while the
nightingale in its turn is killed and eaten for a redstart. To
avoid mistakes, we must observe the following particulars:&mdash;The
female redstart is always smaller, and her plumage darker:
her small feet and beak are blackish; the red of her tail is
lighter, and the two middle feathers are blackish, or very dark
brown; this long slender tail is in continual motion, while the
nightingale moves his only at intervals, for example, when he
has hopped a few steps, and he generally carries it raised
higher than the point of his wings. His step and attitude are
prouder, and his actions seem more deliberate. When he
walks, it is by measured regular hops. After a certain number
he stops, looks at himself, shakes his wings, raises his tail
gracefully, spreads it a little, stoops his head several times,
raises his tail again, and proceeds. If any object attracts his
attention, he bends his head towards it, and generally looks at
it with only one eye. It is true that he jumps hastily upon
the insects which constitute his food; but he does not seize
them so eagerly as other birds; on the contrary, he stops short,
and seems to deliberate whether it is prudent to eat them or
not. Generally he has a serious circumspect air, but his foresight
is not proportioned to it, for he falls readily into all the
snares which are laid for him. If he once escapes, however,
he is not so easily caught again, and becomes as cunning as any
other bird. The same, indeed, may be said of all birds pursued
by man. Nightingales are called, in my opinion very unjustly,
silly and curious; for a great number of new things may be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
offered them without exciting the least attention; but scratch
or dig the earth, and they approach directly, because instinct
or experience tells them that they shall there find insects,
which they are very fond of. Many other species of this group
do the same thing; for instance, the blackcap and the red-breast,
without its having been mentioned. These birds do not, however,
deserve so much of our attention as the nightingale.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Habitation.</span>&mdash;When wild, nightingales are found throughout Europe, as
far as the north of England and the middle of Sweden: in all Asia, as far
as the temperate regions of Siberia; and in Africa on the banks of the
Nile. They every where choose for their residence places which are shady,
cool, but not cold, such as woods, thickets, and even mere hedges in the
fields. They do not go beyond the skirts of the forests on high chains of
mountains, and never stop on elevations where the air is too keen. Groves,
thick brambles, tufted bushes near fields and meadows, are their favourite
abodes. They also like gardens planted with untrimmed elm-hedges,
which are consequently thick and bushy down to the ground. It is not
true that they like watery situations, and if they frequent them it is not for
the water, but because they generally produce thick tufted bushes. It
must also be owned that their favourite food is more constantly abundant in
such places, and if the cold destroys the insects elsewhere, plenty may
always be found in them. It is not however the less certain that the water
is not the attraction, or all would repair to its vicinity, which experience
contradicts. The fact is, that each nightingale generally establishes himself
in the place which gave him birth, whether near the water or not, whether
in an orchard or on a mountain; and when once he has fixed on a spot, he
returns to it every year, unless the place has lost its charm or advantage.
If the wood for instance has been cut down, or has lost the thick shade,
which was its chief merit, in such circumstances he seeks in the neighbourhood
another spot more to his liking. But if, in a considerable circuit
where no change has taken place, a nightingale is seen to establish himself
in a spot which was unoccupied the preceding year, it may be concluded
that it is a young bird which was born in the vicinity. Convenient places
are so much valued, that if the possessors die or are caught, new comers
seize upon them immediately; so that the bird which we hear to-day, is
very possibly not the same which sang yesterday in the same place. Many
other causes may also concur in producing this change of inhabitants, which
an ear well versed in the language of these birds will always discover.</p>

<p>It may, perhaps, be asked why, in many places which appear so well
adapted to attract nightingales, none are found<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">73</a>. I reply that these spots
may be concealed by woods or mountains, and not lie perceived by the
nightingales in their journeys, or they may be quite out of their route, for
they have a regular one which they never quit, because, their progress being
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>slow, and subject to interruptions, it is requisite that they should find on
their passage every thing necessary for their subsistence, and too cold an
atmosphere is painful to them. It may also happen that the nightingales
which formerly frequented them, may have been altogether extirpated;
and as it has been said that the young always establish themselves in the
district which gave them birth, it is by no means surprising that they should
not be chosen, at least there are many chances against it. Rather than
wait in vain for this chance, there is a means of re-peopling such places with
these charming birds. It is only necessary to bring up some broods of
young ones, and not let them loose in the following spring till after the
period of return is elapsed; because being no longer excited by the instinct
which induces them to travel, and the instinct itself being subdued in a
great measure by their imprisoned education, they will not wander, but
will remain and propagate, provided they are not disturbed, and will return
the year following with all their family. I must not omit to say that the
young intended for this re-peopling must not be confined in a cage, as they
would lose the use of their wings, and run the risk of perishing the first day
of their liberation. As soon as they can feed themselves, they must be allowed
an entire room, in which they may fly freely, and grow strong and bold. A
sort of grove should be formed of branches or small trees, and nature should
be imitated as much as possible also in feeding them, by throwing to them
more insects and ants&#8217; eggs than usual, to accustom them to seek for them.</p>

<p>The period of the nightingale&#8217;s return throughout the greater part of
Germany, is the middle of April, rarely either earlier or later<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">74</a>: it is
always when the white-thorn begins to expand its leaves. Advancing
slowly and gradually, these birds are not so likely to suffer from bad
weather as those which go straight to their destination by one stage. In
the middle of August each family prepares to depart; this is done quietly,
removing gradually, and passing from grove to grove to the end of their
journey; then it is that these birds are caught with nooses or springes, by
using elderberries or currants for a bait. The middle of September is the
latest period at which they are seen in Germany. All then disappear
imperceptibly, so that the time they employ in the rest of their journey is
altogether unknown. Other birds, whose instinct leads them to travel in
large flights, do not so easily escape observation. If by accident a
nightingale is met with at the end of September, or in October, it must
have been delayed by some peculiar circumstance; for instance, it may be
a young one that has lost its way, or that was hatched late, or it may be
an invalid.</p>

<p>In confinement nightingales may be allowed to fly freely, as I have
often permitted them; but they do not then sing so well as when in a
cage, where they are less subject to interruptions, and where also they
live longer and more healthily, from being fed with more care and
regularity. The nightingale&#8217;s cage, of whatever form, must not be less
than a foot and a half in length, by about one in width, and one or more
in height. The top should be made of linen or soft stuff, that when
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>jumping and struggling, especially when first caught, he may not injure
his head. The drinking-cup and feeding-trough are fastened on the
outside, unless it is preferred to introduce the latter within, in the form of
a drawer. The following are the best form and proportions for a
nightingale&#8217;s cage, that I am acquainted with:&mdash;Length, one foot and a
half; breadth, eight inches; height, fifteen inches in the middle; thirteen
at the sides, because the roof is arched. The sides are made of osiers
about a quarter of an inch thick; the bottom is made of the same
material, but it is covered by a drawer an inch and a quarter in depth.
In order to clean it more easily, I cover it with coarse paper, which I
renew every time. The feeding-trough is introduced on one side, with
edges high enough to prevent the bird&#8217;s spilling too much of the food.
In the middle of the front of the cage, and extending from top to bottom,
is a cylindrical projection in the form of a belfry, in which is suspended a
large drinking-glass. The upper stick of the cage is confined here, terminating
in a fork, or fixed to a semi-circle, that the projection may not be
prevented from moving. This projection is made of osiers, like the rest
of the cage. The middle and lower sticks are covered with green cloth,
firmly sewed on, that the nightingale may have a softer perch, and not
have his feet so soon injured, which is very common with imprisoned birds.
The arched roof is also covered with green stuff, which is painted that
colour with oil paint, as well as the whole of the cage. But it must be
well dried, and quite free from smell before the bird is put into it.</p>

<p>My reasons for preferring this cage are, first, because being small, it
occupies less room, without disadvantage to the bird or to the apartment;
second, because the size of the osiers leave small intervals for the admission
of light, and it is consequently darker; third, because the bird can
bathe without wetting his cage or his perches: and consequently his feet
remain cleaner and more healthy.</p>

<p>As to the situation of the cage, the prisoner&#8217;s taste must be consulted.
Some nightingales dislike being in the window, and prefer a dark corner of
the room; others like the light and the sun. If it is wished that a
nightingale should sing everywhere, it is necessary, when he is moulting,
and before he resumes his song, to accustom him to a change of place, by
carrying him sometimes here, sometimes there. Some will sing only
when they are alone, while others like to perform alternately with a
neighbour; but they never sing so loud and well when there are several
in a room. Perhaps jealousy is the chief cause of this. On these occasions,
the first that begins generally maintains the superiority; the others sing
only when he stops, and this but seldom, and in an under tone. Some
are so sulky that they will not sing at all. Some of these obstinate
pouters are occasionally, from their silence, mistaken for females, and
consequently dismissed from the room, but when they find themselves
alone they begin to sing at full stretch.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Food.</span>&mdash;When wild nightingales feed on insects, especially little green
caterpillars, of which they clear the bushes and trees, small butterflies,
flies, and beetles, and the grubs of insects hid among moss or in the
earth, which are discovered by turning it up. At their departure, towards
the end of summer, they also eat elderberries and currants.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span></p>

<p>In confinement, meal worms and fresh ants&#8217; eggs are the first things
which should be offered to birds which are just caught; in place of these,
when it is not possible to procure them, some persons prepare a mixture
of hard eggs, ox heart, and white bread, some mouthfuls of which they
force the birds to swallow, and then throw some meal worms on the
rest, to induce the nightingale to eat it; but this artificial food is so unfit
for these birds, especially at first, that it kills the greater number. They
may also be injured by forcibly opening their delicate beak. When ants'
eggs cannot be procured, it is better to set the birds at liberty than thus
to sacrifice them. Their best food in summer is ants&#8217; eggs, to which are
daily added two or three meal worms<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">75</a>; when none of the former remain
fresh they must be supplied by dried or rather roasted ox heart and raw
carrot, both grated, and then mixed with dried ants&#8217; eggs<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">76</a>. The carrot,
which may be preserved fresh in sand in the cellar, prevents heat in the
stomach and bowels; a little lean beef or mutton minced small may also
be used sometimes; after different trials, it is in this way I feed my
nightingales. The cheapest food is very ripe elderberries, dried and
mixed with ants&#8217; eggs, in the same way as the carrots and white bread.</p>

<p>Some bird-fanciers, in winter, bake a little loaf made of the flour of peas
and eggs, which they grate, moisten, and then mix with dried ants&#8217; eggs;
others, who would still be more economical, pound poppy-seeds in a mortar
to express the oil, and then mix them with the crumb of white bread; when
accustomed to it the birds seem very fond of it, but a proof that it does not
agree with them is that they soon fall into a decline and die. This plan
has lately been introduced into Thuringia; but knowing, as I do from experience,
that the stomach of the nightingale is not formed to digest such
food, since he is not graminivorous, I take care never to administer it; and
I think I ought to warn others against it. The best will always be the
simplest, and that which is most conformable to nature. Those who adopt
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>that which I have mentioned will have the satisfaction of finding their
nightingales healthy, cheerful, active, and good singers.</p>

<p>I have already said that I have tried letting them run about the room,
feeding them upon the common universal paste; but this food is not sufficiently
nutritious for them: on this diet they can hardly pass six months
without falling into a decline, and they would inevitably perish if they were
not speedily restored to one which is fitter for them. They require fresh
water every day, as well for bathing as drinking; they habitually bathe,
when caged, after singing. They have also been observed to do so the first
thing in the evening, when the candles were lighted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Breeding.</span>&mdash;Each nightingale has his little district; and if in the pairing
season several males are found together, very angry battles take place, which
end in the flight of the weakest. The commonest quarrels of this kind are
between fathers and sons. The latter, having been born in the place, determine
to fix themselves in it; all feeling of relationship is then extinguished,
and they are strangers; the relations of father and son, those sweet
ties, hitherto so close, are suddenly broken, never more to be felt.</p>

<p>The nest is built in a grove or orchard, among a heap of branches, or on
a thorn bush, or the trunk of a tree surrounded by briars; or even on the
ground when it may be hid by tall grass or thick bushes. Its form is
simple and inartificial, on the outside dry leaves, on the inside hay, fine
roots, with the hair of animals, is all the apparatus. The female lays from
four to six eggs, of a brownish green, on which she sits a fortnight. The
young are fed with small caterpillars and butterflies. As the low position
of the nest exposes them to become the prey of carnivorous quadrupeds,
they soon quit it, even before they can fly. Their plumage before moulting
has no resemblance to that of the old birds except the red of the tail; the
upper part of the body is of a reddish grey, spotted with yellowish white on
the head and coverts of the wings; the under part is of a rusty yellow,
spotted on the breast with dark brown; but after moulting the resemblance
is so perfect that they can hardly be distinguished. If, therefore, any of
these birds are caught towards the end of summer, they are carefully examined
on the back of the head, round the eyes, and under the beak and
neck, for, provided there remains in these places a small feather, or mere
yellow point, it is sufficient to ascertain that they are young. As these are
the only means of judging, if no marks appear, it is necessary to wait for a
few days till the bird begins to sing. This, however, is not a sure sign, as
the young females sing as well as the males, till the month of April, though
in a weaker and more unconnected way, and without so visibly swelling
their throats: it is by these nice observations that connoisseurs succeed in
distinguishing them. It may also be remarked, as a help to those who wish
to rear nightingales, that, when in the nest, those which are marked with
white, and especially those which have a white throat, are males; the reddest
and brownest being always females. The young, when taken, are fed with
ants&#8217; eggs mixed with white bread, grated and moistened. The males begin
to warble even before their tails are quite grown: if the father and mother
are taken at the same time as the young ones, they will, when caged, continue
to feed them as before. It is said that nightingales sometimes build
in the bird room; this, however, can only succeed by giving up to a tame
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>healthy pair a whole room, in which a sort of grove should be formed of
branches.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diseases.</span>&mdash;In general moulting amounts to a disease among nightingales:
at this critical time they require a more succulent diet, and sometimes a
spider by way of purgative. If their stomach is disordered they puff up
their feathers, half shut their eyes, and remain for hours with their head
under their wing. They are relieved and cured by ants&#8217; eggs, some spiders,
and by giving them occasionally water impregnated with saffron till it is of
an orange colour, to drink.</p>

<p>As to those diseases which they have in common with other birds, they
are treated according to the directions given in the Introduction. It is
especially necessary, every three months, carefully to remove the large scales
from their legs and toes. A nightingale may be kept in confinement fifteen
years; whilst in a wild state they are never observed to exist so long in
the same spot, which seems to prove that they do not attain so great an age
when exposed to all sorts of accidents, both from birds of prey and bird-catchers.
I have an instance of a nightingale which has lived twenty-five
years in confinement. When they have reached six years they begin to
sing less frequently and long, with less brilliancy and ornament; it is then
better to set them at liberty in the month of May. The open air often
invigorates them so much that they regain their song in all its force and
beauty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mode of Taking.</span>&mdash;Nothing is easier than to catch a nightingale in the
season of pairing. If a little furrow, smooth at the bottom, is dug in a dark
soil, and some meal worms or ants&#8217; eggs are thrown into it, he will immediately
fly to these delicacies. By putting also in the same place limed
twigs, or a small net which may be easily dropped, he will soon be caught;
it is even sufficient to fix over the furrow a bit of wood supported by a
stick, which will fall as soon as the bird perches upon it. He is so unsuspicious
that he observes the snare being laid, and then foolishly falls into
it, when the bird-catcher has moved only a few steps from it; he will even
allow himself to be led to it when at a little distance, if in a gentle manner.
A bird-catcher may thus, in a few hours, depopulate a whole district of these
delightful songsters. If, however, this is feared, there is a means of baffling
his intentions, by anticipating him, and catching the nightingale we wish to
preserve in our neighbourhood, either by a limed twig or in a net, and
letting him go again. This experiment will prevent his falling so readily
into the snare in future. In the greater part of Germany, indeed, it is forbidden,
under a very heavy penalty, to catch nightingales. Another mode
of taking them is by nooses and springes, and suspending for a bait, instead
of berries, live meal-worms; but there is one disadvantage attending it, while
struggling the bird almost always injures his feet, especially in springes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attractive Qualities.</span>&mdash;The first good quality of a nightingale is undoubtedly
its fine voice, and notes which I shall endeavour to describe. The
nightingale expresses his different emotions by suitable and particular tones.
The most unmeaning cry when he is alone appears to be a simple whistle
<i>fitt</i>, but if the syllable <i>crr</i> is added, it is then the call of the male to the
female. The sign of displeasure or fear is <i>fitt</i> repeated rapidly and loudly
before adding the terminating <i>crr</i>; whilst that of satisfaction and pleasure
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>such, for example, as conjugal endearments, or on the occasion of finding
a delicate morsel, is a deep <i>tack</i>, which may be imitated by smacking the
tongue.</p>

<p>In anger, jealousy, rivalry, or any extraordinary event, he utters hoarse
disagreeable sounds, somewhat like a jay or a cat. Lastly, in the season of
pairing, when the male and female entice and pursue each other, from the
top of a tree to its base, and thence again to the top, a gentle subdued
warbling is all that is heard.</p>

<p>Nature has granted these tones to both sexes; but the male is particularly
endowed with so very striking a musical talent, that in this respect
he surpasses all birds, and has acquired the name of the king of songsters.
The strength of his vocal organ is indeed wonderful; and it has been found
that the muscles of his larynx are much more powerful than those of any
other bird. But it is less the strength than the compass, flexibility, prodigious
variety, and harmony of his voice which make it so admired by all
lovers of the beautiful. Sometimes dwelling for minutes on a strain composed
of only two or three melancholy tones, he begins in an under voice,
and swelling it gradually by the most superb crescendo to the highest point
of strength, he ends it by a dying cadence; or it consists of a rapid succession
of more brilliant sounds, terminated, like many other strains of his
song, by some detached ascending notes. Twenty-four different strains or
couplets may be reckoned in the song of a fine nightingale, without including
its delicate little variations; for among these, as among other
musicians, there are some great performers and many middling ones. This
song is so articulate, so speaking, that it may be very well written. The
following is a trial which I have made on that of a nightingale in my
neighbourhood, which passes for a very capital singer<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">77</a>:&mdash;</p>

<p>If we could understand the sense of these words, we should doubtless
discover the expression of the sensations of this delightful songster. It is
true that the nightingales of all countries, the south as well as the north,
appear to sing in the same manner; there is, however, as has been already
observed, so great a difference in the degree of perfection, that we cannot
help acknowledging that one has a great superiority over another. On
points of beauty, however, where the senses are the judges, each has his
peculiar taste. If one nightingale has the talent of dwelling agreeably on
his notes, another utters his with peculiar brilliancy, a third lengthens out
his strain in a particular manner, and a fourth excels in the silveriness of
his voice. All four may excel in their style, and each will find his admirer;
and, truly, it is very difficult to decide which merits the palm of
victory. There are, however, individuals so very superior as to unite all
the beauties of power and melody; these are generally birds of the first
breed, which, having been hatched with the necessary powers, in a district
well peopled with nightingales, appropriate what is most striking in the
song of each, whence results this perfect compound, so worthy of our
admiration. As the return of the males in spring always precedes that of
the females by seven or eight days, they are constantly heard to sing before
and after midnight, in order to attract their companions on their journey
during the fine nights. If their wishes are accomplished they then keep
silence during the night, and salute the dawn with their first accents,
which are continued through the day. Some persist in their first season
in singing before and after midnight, whence they have obtained the name
of nocturnal nightingales; but they cannot be distinguished till after some
time, when they are established in their district, and have the society of
their females. After repeated experiments for many successive years, I
think I am authorised in affirming that the nocturnal and diurnal nightingales
form distinct varieties, which propagate regularly: for if a young
bird is taken from the nest of a night singer, he, in his turn, will sing at
the same hours as his father, not the first year, but certainly in the following<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">81</a>;
while, on the other hand, the young of a day nightingale will
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>never sing in the night, even when it is surrounded by nocturnal nightingales.
I have also remarked that the night singers prefer mountainous
countries, and even mountains themselves, whilst the others prefer plains,
valleys, and the neighbourhood of water. I will also venture to affirm
that all the night singers found in the plains have strayed from the mountains;
thus in my neighbourhood, inclosed in the first chains of the mountains
of Thuringia, we hear only night singers, and in the plains of Gotha
they know only the day nightingale.</p>

<p>It is a pity that the time for this delightful bird&#8217;s song should be so
short, that is to say, when wild. It endures hardly three months; and
during this short interval it is not maintained with equal power. At its
first arrival it is the most beautiful, continued, and impassioned; when
the young are hatched, it becomes more rare; the attentions which they
require occupying considerable time. If from time to time the nightingale&#8217;e
song is heard, it is evident that the fire which animated it is much
weakened. After midsummer all is ended, nothing is heard but the warbling
of the young, which seem to study their father&#8217;s song, and try to
imitate it. The nightingale sings much longer in confinement: birds
which are caught full grown sometimes sing from November to Easter;
those which are bred from the nest sing much longer, sometimes as long
as seven months; but in order that they may sing well they must be put
under the instruction of an old nightingale which is a good singer, otherwise
they will be only stammerers, mutilating their natural song, and inserting
in a confused manner tones and passages which they have caught from
other birds. If, however, they have a good instructor, and a good memory,
they imitate perfectly, and often add to their instructor&#8217;s song some
beauties of their own, as is usual among young birds<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">82</a>.</p>

<p>I cannot help here mentioning the cruel and disgusting selfishness of
some men, who, in order a little to prolong the song of this interesting
bird, sacrifice to their transient gratification its eyes, by blinding it, as is
done to the lark and the chaffinch.</p>

<p>It is said that a nightingale and a female red-breast running free in the
room will sometimes pair, and produce mules, but I have no experience on
this subject.</p>

<p>I cannot better complete my account of the nightingale&#8217;s song than by
transcribing the delightful, though somewhat exaggerated picture, which has
been given of it by Buffon. &#8220;There is no well organised man,&#8221; says he,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>&#8220;to whom the name of the nightingale does not recall some one of those
fine nights in spring, when the sky being clear, the air calm, all nature
silent, and as it were attentive, he has listened with delight to the song of
this chorister of the woods. Several singing birds may be named whose
voices in some respects may compete with that of the nightingale; the
lark, the canary, the greenfinch, the blackcap, the linnet, the goldfinch, the
common blackbird, the solitary thrush, the American mocking-bird, are
all listened to with pleasure when the nightingale is silent: some have
fine tones, others have their voice as clear as it is soft, others have as fine
flourishes, but there is not one which the nightingale does not surpass in
the complete union of all these different talents, and in the prodigious
variety of his songs; so that the song of each of the above-named birds is,
when taken in its whole extent, only one couplet of that of the nightingale.
The nightingale always charms, and never copies himself servilely; if he
repeats any passage it is animated with a new accent, embellished by new
ornaments. He succeeds in all styles, he renders all expressions, he seizes
all characters, and he also augments their effect by contrast. If this Coryph&aelig;us
of the spring prepares to sing a hymn to nature, he begins by a timid
prelude, by faint uncertain sounds, as if he would try his instrument and
interest his audience; then gaining courage he becomes gradually animated,
warmed, and he soon displays in their plenitude all the resources of his
incomparable organ, brilliant bursts, lively delicate trills, volleys of notes
whose distinctness equals their volubility; an internal dull murmur, not
itself pleasing to the ear, but very fit to enhance the brilliancy of the
agreeable strains, sudden, brilliant, and rapid runs, articulated with
strength, and even a tasteful ruggedness, plaintive accents, tender cadences;
sounds dwelt on without art, but swelling with sentiment; enchantingly
penetrating notes, the true sighs of voluptuousness and love, which seem to
come from the heart, and make all hearts palpitate; which produce in all
who are not insensible a delightful emotion, a touching languor. In those
impassioned tones are recognised the language of sentiment which a happy
husband addresses to his beloved partner, and which she alone can inspire;
while in other strains, more surprising perhaps, but less expressive, are discovered
the simple wish of amusing and pleasing her, or of disputing before
her the prize of singing with rivals jealous of his glory and happiness.</p>

<p>&#8220;These different strains are interspersed with pauses which in all styles
of melody concur in producing great effects. We dwell on the beautiful
notes we have just heard, and which still resound in our ears; we enjoy
them the more because the pleasure is more limited, more exclusive, and
undisturbed by new sensations. Soon we expect, we desire another strain;
we hope it may be pleasing; if we are mistaken, the beauty of what we
hear will not leave us room to regret that which is only delayed, and the
interest of hope is maintained for the strains which will follow. One of
the reasons why the song of the nightingale is so striking, and produces so
much effect, is, as Mr. Barington has well said, because he sings in the
night, which is the most favourable time, and he sings alone, whereby his
voice is heard in all its splendour, and is undisturbed by any other voice.
He eclipses all other birds, adds Mr. Barington, by his soft flute-like tones,
and by the uninterrupted duration of his warble, which lasts sometimes for
twenty seconds. The same observer reckoned in this warble sixteen dif<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>ferent
strains, well marked by their first and last notes, the intermediate
notes being tastefully varied by the bird; and he ascertained that the space
filled by the nightingale&#8217;s voice is no less than an English mile in diameter,
especially when the air is calm: this equals the compass of the human
voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is surprising that so small a bird, which weighs only half an ounce,
should have such force in the vocal organs. Mr. Hunter has observed that
the muscles of the larynx, or gullet, are stronger in proportion, in this
species, than in any other, and also stronger in the male which sings, than
in the female which does not sing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aristotle, and Pliny after him, say, that the song of the nightingale
lasts in all its strength for fifteen days and fifteen nights uninterruptedly,
at the time that the trees are putting forth their leaves; this can refer only
to wild nightingales, and must not be taken literally; for these birds are
not silent either before or after the period fixed by Aristotle. It is true
they do not continue to sing with so much ardour and constancy. They
generally begin in the month of April, and do not completely end till the
month of June, about the time of the solstice; but the time when their
song diminishes most, is when the young are hatched, because they are
then occupied in feeding them, and in the order of instincts, that which
tends to the preservation of the species is pre-eminent. Captive nightingales
continue to sing for nine or ten months, and their song is sustained
not only for a longer time, but it is more perfect and studied. Hence
Mr. Barington infers, that in this species, and in many others, the male
does not sing to amuse the female, and enliven her fatigue when sitting;
which appears a very just and probable inference. Indeed, the female
when she sits performs her office from an instinct, or rather a passion,
stronger in her than even the passion of love; she finds in it an internal
satisfaction of which we can form no idea, but which she appears to feel
sensibly, and we cannot therefore suppose that at such moments she is in
any want of consolation. Since then it is neither from duty nor virtue
that the female sits, neither is it on that account that the male sings: indeed
he does not sing during the second incubation. It is love, and especially
the first season of love, which inspires the song of the bird; it is in
spring that they experience the want both to love and to sing; it is the
males which have most desire, and it is they who sing the most. They
continue to sing during the greater part of the year if we preserve around
them a perpetual spring, which incessantly renews their ardour, without
affording an occasion for extinguishing it; this happens to caged nightingales,
and even, as it has been already mentioned, to those which have
been taken full grown. Some have been known to begin to sing with all
their strength a few hours after being caught. They must, however, have
been insensible of their loss of liberty at first. They would starve the first
seven or eight days if they were not fed, and would injure their heads
against the top of the cage if their wings were not tied; but at last the passion
for singing prevails, because it is produced by a still deeper passion.</p>

<p>&#8220;The songs of other birds, the sounds of instruments, the tones of a
sweet sonorous voice, excite them much. They run, they approach, attracted
by the sweet sounds; but duets attract them still more powerfully,
which would seem to prove that they are sensible to the effects of harmony.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>They do not continue silent auditors, they join the performance, and use
all their efforts to eclipse their rivals, to surpass all the other voices, and
even all other sounds. It is said that they have been known to drop down
dead at the feet of a person singing. Another has been seen fluttering,
swelling his throat, and uttering an angry warble every time a canary
which was near him, began to sing; he succeeded by his threats in imposing
silence, so true is it, that superiority is not always free from jealousy.
Can it be in consequence of the passion for pre-eminence, that these birds
are so careful to seize every advantage, and that they prefer singing in a
place favourable to sound, or within reach of an echo?</p>

<p>&#8220;All nightingales do not sing equally well. Some are so very inferior
as not to be worth keeping. It has even been thought that the song of
the nightingale is different in different countries. In England, those who
are curious respecting these birds, prefer, it is said, those of the county of
Surrey, to those of Middlesex; as they prefer the greenfinch of Essex, and
the goldfinch of Kent. This diversity of song among birds of the same
species has very rationally been compared to the different dialects of the
same language. The true causes can hardly be assigned, as they are for the
most part accidental. A nightingale may perhaps have heard other singing
birds, or emulation may have caused him to perfect his song, which he
thus transmits improved to his descendants, for every father is the singing
master of his family; and it is easy to perceive that in succeeding generations
the song may be still further improved or modified by similar accidents.</p>

<p>&#8220;After the month of June, the nightingale sings no more, and he retains
only a hoarse cry, a sort of croaking, by which the melodious Philomel
cannot be recognised, and it is not surprising that formerly, in Italy,
they gave him a different name under these circumstances. He is indeed
another bird, a bird altogether different in respect of voice, and even, in a
great degree, in respect of the colour of his plumage.</p>

<p>&#8220;Among nightingales, as well as other species, some females are found
participating in the constitution of the male, his habits, and especially in
his musical powers. I have seen, in confinement, one of these female
singers. Her warble resembled that of the male, but was neither so strong
nor so varied. She preserved it till spring; but then subduing the exercise
of her talent to the natural duties of her sex, she became silent, in
order to build her nest, and to lay, though she was solitary. It appears
that, in warm countries, such as Greece, it is very common to see these
female singers, and respecting this species and many others we may draw
the same inference from a passage of Aristotle. One would hardly imagine
that so varied a song as that of the nightingale is confined within a single
octave; this is, however, the result of the attentive observations of a man
of taste (M. le docteur Remond). He remarked, indeed, some sharp
tones which formed the double octave, and which were emitted like lightning;
but this happens rarely, and when the bird by a powerful effort of
the gullet raises his voice to the octave.</p>

<p>&#8220;The same observer discovered shakes on the third, fourth, and octave,
but always from sharp to flat; cadences, generally in the minor, on almost
every note; but no arpeggios, no coherent design.&#8221;</p>

<p>Independent of these talents, the nightingale possesses a quality very
likely to augment the number of his friends; he is capable, after some
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>time, of forming attachments. When once he has made acquaintance with
the person who takes care of him, he distinguishes his step before seeing
him; he welcomes him by a cry of joy; and, during the moulting season,
he is seen making vain efforts to sing, and supplying by the gaiety of his
movements, and the expression of his looks, the demonstrations of joy
which his throat refuses to utter. When he loses his benefactor, he sometimes
pines to death; if he survives it is long before he is accustomed to
another<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">83</a>. His attachments are long, because they are not hasty, as is the
case with all wild and timid dispositions.</p></div>

<p class="center">Motacilla Luscinia major, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; Le Grand Rossignol, ou La Progn&eacute;<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">84</a>,

<p><span class="smcap">Naturalists</span> make this bird only a variety, or at most, only
a species of the common nightingale; but I find points of difference
so numerous and so striking, that I think it right to
make it a distinct species. 1. It is larger by an inch and a half in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>length, being six inches and a half, of which the tail, also half
an inch longer, occupies two and three-quarters; 2. The head
is larger, and the beak is thicker; 3. The colours are different;
4. The song is different. With respect to gait, manner, habits,
and the like, it is true there is a resemblance, which exists,
however, only in common with the white-throats, and the blackcap,
which have never been considered as varieties of the nightingale.</p>

<p>The upper part of the body is a dusky brownish grey; the
throat is white bordered with black; the breast is brown, with
darker spots; the belly dirty white; the wings are deep brown,
edged with dirty red; the tail and its upper large coverts dirty
maroon, deeper than in the common nightingale; the whole
plumage, in short, is generally and in all parts deeper and
darker.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Observations.</span>&mdash;The difference in the song is very remarkable. The
greater nightingale has a much stronger, louder, and deeper voice; but it sings
more slowly and more unconnectedly; it has not that astonishing variety,
those charming protractions, and harmonious conclusions of the common nightingale;
it mutilates all the strains; and, on this account, its song has been
compared to the missel-thrush, to which, however, it is superior in softness
and pureness. The common nightingale is superior in delicacy and variety,
but inferior in force and brilliancy. The greater nightingale sings generally
in the night, so that it is the real night-singer; while among nightingales
this is rather uncommon. Its voice is so loud that it is almost impossible
to bear it in a room. It is necessary to keep it always outside the window,
either by hanging its cage there, or by opening from it a sort of passage into
which it can remove.</p>

<p>Its call is also very different; <i>hi! glack arrr!</i> It seems also to pronounce
<i>David, Jacob</i>, and generally begins its song by the latter word. If
the song is complete, it consists of the following strains:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent2">
<i>Guia, gu, gu, gu.<br />

<p>This bird is not found in any part of Thuringia. There are some in
Silesia, Bohemia, Pomerania, near Wittenberg, Halle, and Dessau; but
in Austria, Hungary, and Poland, they are in some districts more
abundant than the common nightingale<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">85</a>. They generally settle among
the bushes of the hills and plains, and especially near rivers. When
caged they are fed like nightingales. They are less delicate, however, and
live much longer.</p>

<p>They are chiefly brought from Vienna to Thuringia, whence they have
the name of Vienna Nightingales. Some people make a business of
fetching them from Hungary, in the beginning of April, where they buy
them cheap, in order to sell them very dear, in Saxony and other remote
provinces. Those from Hungary are preferred to the Polish. A distinguishing
characteristic is, that they first pronounce the <i>davitt</i> or <i>jacob</i>
only once when they call; while the second repeat <i>davitt</i> many times in
succession.</p>

<p>At Thorn, and all along the Vistula, where the common and the large
nightingale equally abound, the latter is called the Polish Nightingale,
and the former, the Nightingale of Saxony. The nest of the greater
nightingale is built like that of the nightingale; but the eggs are larger,
and of an olive brown, with dark shades.</p>

<p>These birds are caught like nightingales; their diseases, also, are
similar; but they appear to suffer still more when moulting; they become
dull and ill, and often die under it. It is usual to give them at this
crisis some spiders, and the grubs which gnaw wood; what, however,
after many experiments, appears most salutary, is the Golden Tincture
of Halle<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">86</a>, one or two drops of which are poured into the drinking-trough.</p></div>

<h4>THE BLACKCAP.</h4>

<p class="center">Sylvia atricapilla, <span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>; La Fauvette &agrave; t&ecirc;te noire, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Die schwarzk&ouml;pfige
Grasm&uuml;cke, <span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> distinguished singer among birds, bears, in Germany,
the name of <i>Monk</i>, or <i>Moor</i>, from the black or brown cap
which covers the top of his head. These two colours have led
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>some to divide them into two species, but it is quite certain
that they only designate the sex; the black marking the male,
and the brown the female. Its length is five inches and five-sixths,
two and a half of which belong to the tail. The beak
is five lines in length, formed like that of the nightingale, and
is of a brownish blue, with the edges of the lower base and
the interior of a yellowish white; the iris maroon; the feet
ten lines high, are dark ash-colour; all the top of the head
is black; the cheeks and upper part of the neck are light ash-colour;
the upper part of the body, as well as the coverts of
the wings, ash-colour, tending to olive; the under part of the
body is light grey, fading to white under the belly and breast;
the sides and thighs are the same colour as the back; the under
coverts of the tail and wings are speckled gray and white; the
pen-feathers and tail-feathers are dark brown, edged with the
colour of the back.</p>

<p>The female is rather larger; her cap is reddish brown; the
upper part of her body reddish grey, tending to olive; the
cheeks and throat are light grey; the breast, the sides, and the
thighs, are light grey, varying to light olive; the belly is
reddish white.</p>

<p>The silky plumage of this bird is so delicate and frail, that
it is rare to see one in confinement, whether hopping freely, or
caged, which has not its tail or its wings disfigured.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Habitation.</span>&mdash;When wild, this bird is found throughout Europe,
inhabiting woods and orchards, or their vicinity; it particularly loves
thick copse-wood. In September it leaves our climate, and returns
about the middle of April, to enliven our woods by its brilliant and well
supported song.</p>

<p>In confinement, when it is allowed to hop about, it is provided with a
branch, or a roost furnished with several sticks, because it walks with
difficulty, and prefers perching, on which account a cage is better adapted
to it. At the time for departure, these birds, urged by the instinct to
travel, are much agitated, especially in the night, by moonlight. The
desire to rove is so strong, that they often fall ill and die.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Food.</span>&mdash;When wild, the blackcap feeds on small caterpillars, butterflies,
flies, in short, of all kinds, on insects and their grubs; in time of need, on
berries and fruits also<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">87</a>.</p>

<p>In confinement this bird does very well on the universal paste, with
which a little bruised hemp seed is mixed, and occasionally meal worms,
ants&#8217; eggs, or insects. In summer and autumn he is supplied with elder<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>-berries,
and they are also dried, in order that he may have some in winter,
soaked in water, which is found very good for his health. He is a great
eater, and when at liberty in the bird room partakes of everything, meat,
bread, and even vegetables. As he is generally caught in the autumn he
is soon accustomed to artificial food, by having elderberries and meal
worms mixed with it for several successive days. He is fond of bathing,
and must be always well supplied with fresh water.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Breeding.</span>&mdash;This species generally lays but once a year, occasionally
twice, and even thrice. His nest, placed near the ground, generally in a
hedge or bush of white-thorn, is hemispherical, solid, and well built; the
outside of stalks, deserted cocoons, and stubble, the inside of fine soft hay,
mixed with hair. It contains from four to six eggs, of a yellowish white
mottled with yellow and spotted with brown. The young are fed with
small caterpillars, insects, and currants; those which are brought up by
hand are fed with white bread and milk. The charming tone of their
voice gives to their own song, as well as to that of the nightingale and
canary, which they easily learn to imitate, a sweetness and grace which are
enchanting. Before moulting there is so little difference between the
young males and females that it requires great skill to distinguish them,
for the cap of the former is only a slight shade darker of olive brown, and
the back a greyish brown, rather more tinted with olive; but on the first
moulting the head of the male begins to blacken first behind the beak,
while that of the female retains its original colour, except that it becomes
more bright and distinct. When it is wished to ascertain the sex of these
young birds, the best plan is to pull out a few brown feathers from the
head; if it is a male, black ones will come up in their place, and thus
there will be no danger of taking females by mistake; these, however,
would soon be known, because the males begin to warble as soon as they
are able to fly and feed themselves.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diseases.</span>&mdash;The blackcap is subject to the same diseases as the nightingale,
but is more frequently attacked by decline. As soon as the symptoms
appear he must be fed with a great many meal worms and ants&#8217; eggs, and
his drinking water must be impregnated with iron, by putting a nail into
it. Those which are left to run about the room are apt to lose their
feathers. Under such circumstances they must be caged, and exposed to
the warmth of the sun or the fire; they must be well fed, especially with
the food given to nightingales; these methods generally restore them, and
their feathers are gradually renewed. A tepid bath, repeated for two or
three days, is very likely to help their development. In epileptic or
paralytic attacks I make them swallow, with great success, two or three
drops of olive oil; I lately had the pleasure of seeing the success of this
remedy on a bird of this species suffering from an apoplectic fit, and which
dragged his little paralysed foot about the room where he lived uncaged;
he is now quite recovered, very gay, and active; his song was never before
so delightful to me. These birds generally live in captivity as long as
nightingales.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Modes of Taking.</span>&mdash;Every taste but that of the palate must be destroyed
if this charming bird is caught for the table. Besides, it is by no means
numerous; but if it is desired as an ornament to the house, snares baited
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>with currants must be laid for it in July and August, the greatest care being
taken to save the feet, which are very likely to be broken. Patience is
very necessary in order to succeed, for it is a very suspicious bird, approaching
slowly, and falling into the snare only when pressed by hunger. The
same suspicious disposition causes it to repair with repugnance to the water
trap, though in other situations it delights in water, and often bathes. If it
perceives anything unusual it will remain for hours without approaching, and
will pass twenty times by currants which are hung up as a bait without
touching them, though very greedy of this food; but if it sees another bird
bathe, or drink, it takes courage, and soon falls into the trap. The young,
before moulting, still foolish and inexperienced, are more careless, and may
be taken in great numbers in autumn; and in the spring they are as easy
to catch as the nightingale, by means of a net or limed twigs, in a place
cleared from moss and turf, and baited with meal worms and ants&#8217; eggs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attractive Qualities.</span>&mdash;It is perhaps a sufficient eulogium to say that
this bird rivals the nightingale, and many persons even give it the preference.
If it has less volume, strength, and expression, it is more pure, easy, and
flute-like in its tones, and its song is perhaps more varied, smooth, and
delicate. It sings also for a much longer period, both when wild and in
confinement, its song being hardly suspended throughout the year by day,
and prolonged, like that of the nightingale, far into the night, though begun
at dawn. The female sings also, but in a more limited degree, very much
like the red-breast, which has caused it to be mistaken for a particular species
with a redcap. The call is a sort of smart &#8220;<i>tack</i>,&#8221; repeated quickly several
times. The sudden view of an unknown object, or of an imminent danger,
makes it utter a hoarse disagreeable cry of fear, very like a cat when
hurt<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">88</a>.</p></div>

<h4>THE FAUVETTE.</h4>

<p class="center">Sylvia hortensis, <span class="smcap">Latham</span>; La Fauvette, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Die graue Grasm&uuml;cke,
<span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> length of this bird is five inches, two and a half of which
belong to the tail. The beak, five lines in length, and formed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>as in the preceding, is brown below, light lead-colour above, and
whitish within; the iris is brownish grey; the feet, nine lines
high, are strong, and lead-colour; the upper part of the body
is reddish grey, tinted slightly with olive brown; the cheeks
are darker, and round the eyes whitish; the under part of the
body, including the breast and sides, is light reddish grey; the
belly is white as far as the under coverts of the tail, which are
tinged with reddish grey; the knees are grey; the pen-feathers
and tail-feathers are brownish grey, edged with the colour of
the back, and spotted with white at the tips; the under coverts
of the wings are reddish yellow.</p>

<p>The female differs only in having the under part of the body,
as far as the breast, of a lighter colour.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Habitation.</span>&mdash;When wild, this bird, which is found all over Europe,
appears to prefer the groves and bushes which skirt the forests, as well as
orchards in their vicinity. He arrives some days before the nightingale,
and departs at the end of September.</p>

<p>In confinement he is treated like the blackcap, and, being more delicate,
must be furnished with a cage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Food.</span>&mdash;When wild the fauvette feeds on small caterpillars and the other
little insects which are found on the bushes, where he is continually searching
for them, uttering at the same time the sweetest and softest song. After
midsummer he appears very fond of cherries; he eats the pulp up to the
stone, and this causes his beak to be at this season always stained; he also
likes red currants and elderberries.</p>

<p>In confinement he is so great an eater that if he is not caged he hardly
ever quits the feeding-trough of the nightingale. Though he is more easily
tamed than the blackcap, he seldom survives more than two or three years,
and the artificial food is no doubt the cause. He appears very fond of the
universal paste; but I have often observed that it causes the feathers to fall
off to so great a degree that he becomes almost bare, and then I think he
dies of cold rather than from any other cause<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">89</a>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Breeding.</span>&mdash;The nest of the fauvette, placed in a hedge or bush of white-thorn,
at about three feet above the ground, is well built on the outside
with blades of grass and roots, and inside with the finest and softest hay,
very seldom with moss. The edges are fastened with spiders&#8217; webs and
dry cocoons. The female lays four or five eggs, of a yellowish white,
spotted all over with light ash grey and olive brown. The young, which
are hatched after fifteen days&#8217; sitting, are no sooner fledged than they jump
out of the nest the moment it is approached.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diseases.</span>&mdash;They are the same as in the blackcap; but the fauvette is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>still more subject to the loss of its feathers. It fattens so fast upon the
first universal paste that it often dies from this cause.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mode of Taking.</span>&mdash;These birds may be caught during the whole of the
summer with nooses and springes baited with cherries, red currants, or
elderberries. They go also very readily to the water trap, from seven to
nine in the morning, and in the evening a little before sunset.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attractive Qualities.</span>&mdash;&#8220;Of the inhabitants of our woods,&#8221; says
Buffon, &#8220;fauvettes are the most numerous and agreeable. Lively, nimble,
always in motion, they seem occupied only with play and pleasure; as their
accents express only joy, it is a pretty sight to watch them sporting, pursuing,
and enticing each other; their attacks are gentle, and their combats end
with a song.&#8221;</p></div>

<h4>THE WHITE-BREAST<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">90</a></h4>

<p class="center">Motacilla Fruticeti, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; La Petite Fauvette, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Die rostgraue
Grasm&uuml;cke, <span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> bird, which is but little known, resembles in most
points the preceding, but its figure is smaller and its plumage
darker. Its length is four inches and three quarters, of which
two and a half (being more than half of the whole) belong to
the tail. The beak, four lines in length, is brown above and
yellowish white below and on the edges; the iris dark brown;
the feet, nine lines in height, are pale lead-colour; all the
upper part of the body, comprising the wing-coverts, is dusky
reddish grey, darker towards the head and lighter towards the
rump.</p>

<p>I have never been able to discover any difference between
the plumage of the male and female.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Observations.</span>&mdash;This bird arrives among us towards the end of April.
It frequents hilly places covered with bushes and briars, among which it
builds its nest, about four or five feet from the ground, and among the
thickest foliage. The eggs, five in number, are whitish, mottled with
bluish brown, and speckled with dark maroon. Incubation lasts but
thirteen days. At first the young are fed with the smallest caterpillars,
afterwards with larger ones, flies, and other insects; but as soon as they
can fly they accompany their parents in search of cherries, red currants,
elderberries, and, later in the season, the berries of the service tree. The
family departs together in the month of September, and then some are
taken in nooses or springes baited with elderberries. But this species is not
much valued, and does not therefore excite the attention of bird-catchers,
who give the preference to the fauvette.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span></p>

<p>However, this bird is an excellent singer, and though his voice is not so
clear and flute-like as that of the fauvette, yet by skilfully introducing his
call into his warble, he produces a very striking and agreeable variety.
This species is fed and treated like the preceding, but with still greater
care, for it is even more delicate. With all my care I have never been
able to preserve it more than two years at the utmost: the difficulty,
however, does not appear to proceed from the diet, for being caught in the
autumn it soon gets accustomed to the food of the nightingale, by first
giving it the berries which it selects in a state of freedom.</p></div>

<h4>THE DUNNOCK, OR HEDGE SPARROW.</h4>

<p class="center">Accentor modularis, <span class="smcap">Linnaeus</span>; La Fauvette d&#8217;diver, ou Traine Buisson,
<span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Die Braunelle, <span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> species, which in its gait resembles the wren, seems
also a link between its own species and that of the lark, for it
does not confine itself to insects; it eats all sorts of small
seeds, such as those of the poppy and the grasses. Its length
is five inches and a quarter, two and a quarter of which belong
to the tail. The beak, five lines in length, is very sharp,
black, whitish at the tip, and the inside rose-colour; the iris
purple; the legs, nine lines in height, are yellowish flesh-colour;
the narrow head is, together with the neck, dark
ash-colour, marked with very dark brown, like that of the
sparrow; the breast a deep slate-colour.</p>

<p>The breast of the female is lighter and bluish grey; she has
also more brown spots on her head.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Habitation.</span>&mdash;When wild it is found all over Europe, making its abode
in thick deep forests. It is with us a bird of passage; but some individuals,
which come from quite the north, remain during the winter near
our dwellings, searching the heaps of wood and stones, the hedges and
fences, and, like the wren, entering barns and stables. Those which leave
us return at the end of March, stop for some time in the hedges, and then
penetrate into the woods.</p>

<p>In confinement this bird is so wakeful and gay that it may be safely left
at liberty in the room, having a roosting-place for the night; it is also kept
in a cage.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><img src="images/i_254.png" alt="THE BEARDED TIT." title="" height="670" width="500" />
<p class="caption">THE BEARDED TIT.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Food.</span>&mdash;When wild, the great variety of things which serve it for food
prevent its ever being at a loss throughout the year. It is equally fond of
small insects and worms and small seeds. In spring it feeds on flies, caterpillars,
grubs, and maggots, which it seeks for in the hedges, bushes, and
in the earth. In summer it feeds chiefly on caterpillars; in autumn on
seeds of all kinds and elderberries; and in winter, when the snow has
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>covered all seeds, it has recourse to insects hid in the cracks and crevices
of walls and trees.</p>

<p>In confinement it will eat anything that comes to table. It is fond of
the universal paste, hemp, rape, and poppy-seeds, and refuses none of these
things immediately on being imprisoned, and it soon seems as completely
at ease as if accustomed to confinement<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">91</a>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Breeding.</span>&mdash;This species lays generally twice a year; placing its nest
among the thickest bushes, about five or six feet from the ground; the
outside is composed of mosses, and fibres of roots, and wood, and the inside
is lined with the fur of deer, hares, and the like. The eggs, five
or six in number, are bright bluish green. The young are no sooner
fledged than, like the preceding, they quit the nest. Their plumage is
then very different from that of their parents: the breast is spotted with
grey and yellow, the back with brown and black; lastly, the nostrils and
angles of the beak are rose-coloured. They are easily reared on white
bread and poppy-seeds moistened with milk. As soon as they are tamed
these birds have a great inclination to build in the room. The male and
female collect all the little straws, threads, and similar materials which
they can find, to build a nest among the boughs with which they are supplied
for the purpose. The female lays even when solitary; they may be
paired with red-breasts, and these unions succeed very well.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diseases.</span>&mdash;If it were generally true, that birds in a wild state are never
ill, this species must be excepted; for, however strange it may appear, the
young are subject to the small pox; they are attacked by it while in the
nest, or even after they can fly. I have a young bird of this kind, which,
at a time when this disease prevailed in my neighbourhood, took it; he
recovered, however, tolerably well, but he entirely lost the tail-feathers,
which were never afterwards renewed. Old ones are sometimes caught or
killed whose feet and eyes are ulcerated, or have tumours on them; perhaps
they may be only chilblains. Weavers&#8217; stoves appear to be particularly
injurious to these birds; in two or three months their eyes swell, and
the feathers fall off all round them; the beak is attacked with scurvy, which
spreads to the feet, then all over the body; but they nevertheless continue
to live from eight to ten years in these rooms.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mode of Taking.</span>&mdash;This is very easy at their return in the spring. As
soon as they appear in the hedges, where they soon discover themselves by
the cry &#8220;<i>issri</i>,&#8221; a little place near, where the earth is bare, must be found;
after having placed limed twigs, and thrown among them earth or meal
worms for a bait, the dunnock is gently driven towards them without alarming
him; as soon as he perceives the worms he darts upon them and falls
into the snare. In the autumn they may be caught in the area and with a
noose; in winter in the white-throat&#8217;s trap; but they resort in the greatest
numbers to the water trap, not so much for the sake of bathing as to seek
for dead insects or decayed roots.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attractive Qualities.</span>&mdash;However agreeable this bird may be in the
room, from its good humour, agility, gaiety, and song, it does not deserve
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>the name of winter nightingale, which it bears in some places; its song is
too simple and short; it is a little couplet, composed of a strain of the lark
and one of the wren. The sounds <i>tchondi, hondi, hondi</i> are repeated
frequently and for a long time, always descending a sixth, and gradually
diminishing in power. This song is accompanied with an uninterrupted
movement of the wings and tail, and lasts through the year, except at the
moulting season. Some young ones, reared in confinement, will, if placed
beside a fine singing bird, learn enough of its song to embellish their own.
But, whatever may be asserted on the subject, they never succeed in imitating
the nightingale. When the dunnock disputes with its fellow captives
for a place or for food its anger evaporates in a song, like the crested
lark and the wagtail.</p></div>

<h4>THE RED-BREAST.</h4>

<p class="center">Motacilla rubecula, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; Le Rouge-gorge, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Das Rothkelchen,
<span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> red-breast is almost universally known in Europe.
It is five inches and three quarters long, two and a quarter of
which belong to the tail. The beak is five lines in length,
and horn brown, with the lower base and the inside yellow;
the iris is deep brown; the shanks, eleven lines in height, are
of the same colour; the forehead, cheeks, and under part of
the body, from the beak to the bottom of the breast, are orange
red; the upper part of the body and the wing-coverts dingy
olive; the first wing-coverts have at their tip a little triangular
spot.</p>

<p>The female, which is rather smaller, is not so orange-coloured
on the forehead, and this colour is not so bright upon
the breast; the shanks are a purplish brown; yellow spots
are almost always absent from the wing-coverts; the old females
alone having very small yellow marks.</p>

<p>The males of the first year, which are caught in the spring,
very much resemble the females: they have but very small<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
yellow spots, and sometimes none; the breast is saffron yellow;
but the feet are the distinguishing mark, being always very
dark brown.</p>

<p>This species has varieties, as the white red-breast and the
variegated red-breast. In confinement, by sometimes removing
successively the quill-feathers and tail-feathers out of the moulting
season, they will at last be replaced by white ones. These
birds are very pretty; I have had several in this way, but I
have observed that these last feathers are so weak and delicate
that they are easily injured and broken. This repeated
operation must give pain to the little creatures, on which
account it should be avoided.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Habitation.</span>&mdash;When wild, these birds are found in abundance during
the period of migration, on hedges and bushes, but in summer they must
be sought in the woods. &#8220;This retreat,&#8221; it has been said, &#8220;is necessary
to their happiness: the male is engrossed with the society of his mate, all
other company is troublesome; he pursues eagerly the birds of his species,
and drives them from the district he has chosen for himself; the same
bush never contains two pairs of these birds.&#8221; The red-breasts return to
us (in Germany) about the middle of March<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">92</a>; they stop for about a
fortnight in the hedges, and then proceed into the woods. In October
they return towards the bushes, which they busily search as they travel,
and proceed gradually to their destination. Some delay their departure
till November, some will even remain here and there throughout the
winter, but generally to their cost, as their life is usually sacrificed by
these delays. Necessity then forces them to draw near to houses, dunghills,
and stables, where they are generally caught by men or cats, or die
of hunger and cold if the frost is long and severe, and the snow deep.
Care must be taken in hard weather not to transport them suddenly into
a warm room, the rapid change from cold to heat invariably kills them.
They should at first be put in a cold room, and be gradually accustomed
to warm air; with these precautions they will do as well as those which
are caught in the autumn or spring.</p>

<p>In confinement the inhabitants of my neighbourhood like to see red-breasts
hopping about the room, and they make a roost for them of oak
or elm branches. They find that this bird destroys flies and even bugs.
Such a situation appears to agree with him very well, as he lives in this
way from ten to twelve years. He is so jealous and unsociable that he
must not have a companion; he must be quite alone; a second would
cause battles which would end only with the death of one of the
combatants; if, however, they are equal in strength, and in a large room,
they will divide it, and each taking possession of his half, they remain in
peace, unless one should pass his limits, in which case war begins, and is
maintained to the last extremity.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span></p>

<p>In order the better to enjoy their pretty song, they are provided with a
cage generally resembling that of the nightingale.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Food.</span>&mdash;When wild the red-breast feeds on all sorts of insects, which
are pursued with great skill and agility; sometimes this bird is seen
fluttering like a butterfly round a leaf on which is a fly, or if he sees an
earth-worm he hops forward flapping his wings, and seizes it. In autumn
he eats different sorts of berries.</p>

<p>In confinement, by giving him at first some earth or meal worms, and
in the autumn elderberries, he soon gets accustomed to eat anything: he
picks up crumbs of bread, the little fibres of meat, and the like, but cheese
appears his favourite food. When hopping about the bird-room he likes
the universal paste very much<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">93</a>. He chiefly requires a regular supply of
fresh water, both for drinking and bathing; and he makes himself so wet
as to conceal the colours of his plumage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Breeding.</span>&mdash;The red-breast lays twice a year. The nest, placed near
the ground, either among moss, in the crevices of stones, among the roots
of a tree, or in the hole of an old felled trunk, is carelessly formed of
moss, lined with fine hay, hair, and feathers. She lays from four to six
eggs, of a yellowish white, with lines and spots joined and mixed together
of a reddish colour; the colours become deeper as the spots approach the
large end, where they form a crown of a light brown colour. The young
birds are at first covered with yellow down, like chickens, they then
become grey, and their feathers are edged with dusky yellow; they do not
acquire the orange red till they have moulted. They are easily reared on
white bread soaked in boiled milk. When their cage is placed beside a
nightingale they acquire some parts of his song, which, introduced into
their own, make a very pretty mixture.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diseases.</span>&mdash;Their most common disorder is diarrh&oelig;a, for which some
spiders are administered. Decline is often cured with plenty of ants&#8217; eggs
and meal-worms; but indigestion often proves fatal, especially when it
arises from having eaten too many earth-worms. It may, however, be
cured by making the bird swallow spiders and meal-worms.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mode of Taking.</span>&mdash;In spring, when the red-breasts frequent the hedges
and bushes, sticks are passed transversely through them, on which limed
twigs are fastened, then two persons gently beat the hedge or bush to
drive the birds towards the twigs, where they are soon caught, for red-breasts
have the habit of perching on all the little low projecting branches,
in order that they may discover earth-worms. This sort of red-breast
chase is very common in Thuringia, where many persons keep them.
Limed twigs may also be put in a bare place with earth or meal-worms,
just as for the dunnock. The small nightingale net and the white-throat
trap catch many. They are also caught at the water trap; but the
greatest number are caught in autumn with the noose, baited with elderberries,
which are at that season their favourite food. If they are caught
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>for the room (and it is a pity to hunt so pretty a bird for the table),
it is necessary, in order to preserve their feet, to cover the springes with
felt or cork.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attractive Qualities.</span>&mdash;His pretty plumage, tricks, and great sociability
would be enough to make him charming. He is soon tamed, so as
to come upon the table and eat from a plate or the hand; his cheerfulness
and agility must also give pleasure, always in motion, and bowing after
every hop and calling &#8220;<i>sisri</i>;&#8221; but he is particularly valued on account
of his song. This song is generally more perfect and altogether superior
when he is caged than when hopping about the room. There are however
exceptions. The red-breast sings throughout the year, but in spring his
voice is most brilliant and his melody most enchanting. In a country
residence it is very easy to teach this bird to go and come, whether reared
from the nest or caught full grown.</p></div>

<h4>THE BLUE-BREAST.</h4>

<p class="center">Motacilla Suecica, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; La Gorge bleue, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Das Blaukehlchen,
<span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> bird may be considered as intermediate between the
redstart and the common wagtail, having very strong points of
resemblance with both. Its length is five inches and a half,
of which the tail occupies two and a quarter. The beak is
sharp and blackish, yellow at the angles; the iris is brown;
the shanks are fourteen lines high, of a reddish brown, and
the toes blackish; the head, the back, and the wing-coverts
are ashy brown, mottled with a darker tint; a reddish white
line passes above the eyes; the cheeks are dark brown, spotted
with rust red, and edged at the side with deep ash grey; a
brilliant sky blue covers the throat and half way down the
breast; this is set off by a spot of the most dazzling white, the
size of a pea, placed precisely over the gullet, which, enlarging
and diminishing successively, by the movement of this part
when the bird sings, produces the most beautiful effect.</p>

<p>Some males have two little white spots on the throat, some
even have three, while others have none; these latter are
probably very old, for I have observed that as the bird grows
older the blue deepens, and the orange band becomes almost
maroon.</p>

<p>It is easy to distinguish the female; when young she has a
celestial blue tint on the sides of the throat; this tint deepens<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
with age, and forms two longitudinal lines on the sides of the
neck; no orange band; the throat and gullet are yellowish
blue, edged longitudinally with a black line; the feet are flesh-coloured.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Habitation.</span>&mdash;When wild this species exists all over Europe<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">94</a>. It is a
bird of passage, and when returning towards the north, in the beginning of
April, it stops in large flights near streams, in hedges, and damp fields,
comes even into courts, and on the dunghills of farms, if surprised by snow
and a severe return of cold. In the summer it frequents those parts among
the mountains abounding with water; in August it approaches cabbage
fields enclosed by hedges or bushes. It is very seldom that one or two
pairs build in our country.</p>

<p>In confinement it may be let run about; it soon grows so tame as to
come when called, and feed from the hand. Its rapid motions and races
are amusing; but it must not be allowed to fly high enough to get on the
tables and furniture, as it would soon dirty them. It sings better and
longer when caged. The cage should be, like the nightingale&#8217;e, large
enough for the bird not to spoil its beautiful feathers; the tail-feathers
easily drop if they are rubbed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Food.</span>&mdash;When wild the blue-breast feeds on all sorts of insects; it also
eats elderberries.</p>

<p>In confinement it must at first be fed with ants&#8217; eggs, meal-worms, and
even some earth-worms. If it is kept uncaged these things must be thrown
upon the universal paste, which it will thus learn to relish; but though it
is easily reconciled to it, ants&#8217; eggs, earth and meal-worms, must nevertheless
be occasionally supplied, or it will soon die in decline. When
caged it is fed like nightingales, and on that food it will live seven or eight
years. It is a great eater, and can devour in a day its own weight of the
first universal paste, so that it mutes incessantly. It requires a constant
supply of fresh water for drinking and bathing: it wets itself so much that
it is completely drenched. I have observed for several successive years
that it never bathes till the afternoon<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">95</a>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diseases.</span>&mdash;Diarrh&oelig;a and decline are its commonest disorders. The
treatment has been pointed out in the Introduction.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mode of Taking.</span>&mdash;I often hear it said that the blue-breast is a rare
bird; that in some parts of Germany it appears only every five, or even
ten, years, but I can declare that this opinion arises from a want of observation.
Since I have taught my neighbours to be more attentive to the
time of their passage, they every year catch as many as they please. If in
the first fortnight of April, up to the 20th, cold and snow return, plenty
may be found by merely following the streams, rivers, and ponds, especially
in the neighbourhood of a wood. A proper place is chosen, near the water
and a bush, meal and earth worms are thrown there, with limed twigs, and
soon these poor birds, if ever so little pushed towards it fall blindly into
the snare; they also fall into white-throat traps and nightingale nets. In
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>autumn, when they frequent cabbage grounds to hunt for caterpillars,
plenty may be caught by planting here and there sticks with limed twigs
fastened to them, baited with meal-worms. At this season they sometimes
go to the water trap, but this is not usual. If it happens that any are
caught in nooses or spring traps baited with elderberries, hunger must have
been the cause, and they must have been entirely destitute of food.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attractive Qualities.</span>&mdash;Its beauty, sprightliness, sociability, and song,
unite in rendering the blue-breast delightful. It runs very swiftly, raises
its tail with a jerk, and extends it like a fan, keeping it and the wings in
perpetual motion, uttering the cry of &#8220;<i>fide, fide</i>&#8221; and &#8220;<i>tac, tac</i>.&#8221; It is
unfortunate that it gradually loses the fine blue on the breast in successive
moultings, when confined to the house, and becomes at length of a whitish
grey. In a few days it will become tame enough to eat meal-worms from
the hand, and it will not be long before it comes for them when called by
the voice or whistle. Its song is very agreeable; it sounds like two
voices at once; one deep, resembling the gentle humming of a violin
string, the other the soft sound of a flute.</p>

<p>When at liberty in the room it always seeks the sunshine, and sleeps on
its belly. Its notes very much resemble those of the common wagtail,
but much improved by a violin-like hum.</p></div>

<hr />
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;"><img src="images/i_261.png" alt="THE COMMON WAGTAIL." title="" height="166" width="250" /></div>

<h4>THE COMMON WAGTAIL.</h4>

<p class="center">Motacilla alba, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; La Lavandi&egrave;re, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Die weisse Bachstelze,
<span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> species, well known throughout the old world, is seven
inches in length, of which the tail measures three and a half.
The beak, five lines long, is black, and very pointed; the iris
is dark; the shanks, an inch in height, are slender, and black;
the upper part of the head, as far as the nape, is black, but
the rest of the upper part of the body, the sides of the breast,
and lesser wing-coverts, are bluish ash grey; the forehead,
cheeks, and sides of the neck are white as snow; the throat,
as far as the middle of the breast, is black.</p>

<p>The female is without the white forehead and cheeks, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
black top to the head being somewhat smaller. Some females
have been found with very little of the black cap, and even
without it, the head then being of the same colour as the
back.</p>

<p>The young ones, which are seen in large flocks with the
yellow wagtail around herds of cattle, are so different before
the first moulting, that they have been considered a distinct
species, under the name of the grey wagtail (<i>Motacilla cinerea</i>).
In fact, the whole of the upper part of the body is grey, more
or less pale; the throat and belly dusky white; the breast
is generally crossed by a band, sometimes entire, sometimes
broken, of a grey or brownish colour, and the quill-feathers
are whitish on the outer edge.</p>

<p>It is not surprising to find varieties amongst birds so numerous.
Some are quite white, others variegated, or speckled
with white.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Habitation.</span>&mdash;When wild it is found equally near houses, in the fields
and mountains, and in every place where insects and worms are in plenty.
It is in Germany a bird of passage, which assembles in autumn on the
tiles, like the swallow, to prepare for its departure in the first fortnight of
October<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">96</a>. It returns towards the end of February or beginning of March,
though the weather be not mild; it may come thus early without danger,
as it does not fear to approach houses, on the walls of which it finds flies
that the spring sun has drawn from their retreat; and in the streams it also
finds abundance of aquatic insects.</p>

<p>In the house it may be kept in a cage, or allowed to range; but in
either case it is necessary to scatter plenty of sand about, as it is a very
dirty little bird.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Food.</span>&mdash;When wild, it feeds on gnats, water-spiders, aquatic insects, flies,
and insects that fasten on cattle, round which it often roams. It also
follows the ploughman to feed on the insects turned up by the plough.</p>

<p>In the house nothing tames it so soon as ants&#8217; eggs, meal-worms, flies,
and other insects. By degrees it acquires a taste for other food. In the
cage it must be fed in the same manner as the nightingale.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Breeding.</span>&mdash;This species breeds two or three times in the course of the
season. Its nest, placed in a hole, in a crevice between stones, or even
under a tile, is carelessly formed of moss, small roots, hay, or something of
the kind, and lined with hair and wool. It lays five or six eggs, of a
bluish white, spotted with black. The young ones brought up from the
nest become so tame, that they will go and return like a pigeon, build in
the room, and seek for food for their little ones in the fields.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diseases.</span>&mdash;Though very subject to diarrh&oelig;a, this and the two following
species may be preserved in a room five or six years.</p></div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><img src="images/i_264.png" alt="GREY WAGTAIL." title="" height="265" width="500" />
<p class="caption">GREY WAGTAIL.</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Mode of Taking.</span>&mdash;If there is snow on the ground on their return in
March, it is only necessary to clear a place (below the window will do),
and scatter meal-worms amongst limed twigs, or place these on stones or
wood where the birds assemble, or even fasten a meal-worm to a limed
twig, loosely stuck in the earth, and you may soon catch a wagtail.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attractive Qualities.</span>&mdash;Its handsome plumage, its sprightliness, its
quick and elegant motions, please one as much as its pretty song, which,
without being striking, is varied, and continues the whole year, except
during moulting. I always keep a wagtail amongst my birds, and when
the blackcap, the blue-breast, the lark, and the linnet sing, it seems to
form a counter-tenor.</p></div>

<h4>THE GREY WAGTAIL.</h4>

<p class="center">Motacilla Boarula, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; La Bergeronette, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Die graue Bachstelze,
<span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> beautiful species, like the preceding, is seven inches
in length, of which the tail alone measures four. The beak
is black; the iris brown; the legs, nine lines high, dark flesh-coloured;
the upper part of the body, including the lesser
wing-coverts, dark ash-grey; the head slightly tinted with olive,
and the rump a fine yellow green; there is a white streak
above the eyes, and another, beginning at the inferior base of
the beak, descends the sides of the neck, whilst a black streak
extends from the superior base as far as the eyes; the chin
and throat are black, but the breast and under part of the
body are of the finest yellow.</p>

<p>The throat of the female is not black, but pale orange; her
colours are generally less bright.</p>

<p>Males a year or two old are without the fine black throat;
it is clouded with white.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Habitation.</span>&mdash;In their wild state, these wagtails are found throughout
Europe; but in the greatest number in mountainous and wooded parts,
where the brooks flow over beds of pebbles. They are birds of passage,
and return amongst us the end of February or beginning of March. A
few have been observed to remain during mild winters, when they take up
their abode near dunghills or warm springs.</p>

<p>In the house they should be kept in a nightingale&#8217;s cage, and treated
like one; they are so delicate, that with the greatest care they can rarely
be preserved two years.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Food.</span>&mdash;When wild they prefer aquatic insects, and are continually
chasing them among the plants and stones by the water-side.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span></p>

<p>In the house they should be fed on the same food as the nightingale, to
which they may be gradually accustomed, by throwing amongst it meal-worms
and ants&#8217; eggs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Breeding.</span>&mdash;Their nests, placed by the water-side, in mill-dikes, or
heaps of stones, are formed with rather more art than those of the preceding
species. They begin to lay as early as March, five or six white eggs,
mottled with flesh-colour. The young ones must be reared on ants&#8217; eggs
and the crumb of white bread, soaked in boiled milk.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mode of Taking.</span>&mdash;This is very simple; it is only to plant sticks with
limed twigs and meal-worms attached to them, on the banks, or in the
middle of a stream which they frequent; you will not have to wait long
before some are caught.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attractive Qualities.</span>&mdash;They are as pleasing as the common wagtail;
but their plumage is more brilliant, and their voice stronger. Their beautiful
clear trilling sound renders their song agreeable, though rather short.</p></div>

<h4>THE YELLOW WAGTAIL.</h4>

<p class="center">Motacilla flava, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; La Bergeronette du printemps, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Die gelbe
Bachstelze, <span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> might almost be mistaken for the female of the preceding
species; but it is smaller, or rather shorter, as its tail is not so
long, measuring only two inches and a half. The total length
of this bird is six inches and a half; the beak is dusky; the
iris nut brown; the shanks ten lines high, and black; the
upper part of the body reddish grey, with a decided olive tint,
which on the rump becomes a canary green; the head inclines
more to grey than green, and above the eyes is a reddish
white streak; the under part of the body is of a fine yellow,
which becomes citron from age, and is palest at the throat and
breast.</p>

<p>The back of the female is greyer; the belly of a less beautiful
yellow; the throat whitish, and, with the breast as far
as the belly, spotted with red or rust colour, in the male.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Habitation.</span>&mdash;When wild, this species, better known than the preceding,
is found throughout the plains of Europe, running about the
pastures amongst the sheep and cattle. They assemble in September, and
depart for warmer countries in large flights, uttering the cry &#8220;<i>sipp,
sipp!</i>&#8221; in a clear tone; they return in March.</p>

<p>It must be treated like the grey wagtail, in the house; but it is not so
delicate.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Food.</span>&mdash;When wild it feeds on flies and other insects that tease the
cattle.</p>

<p>In the house it must be fed like the preceding.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Breeding.</span>&mdash;Its nest, made of stubble, and lined with wool, is placed
at the water-side, or in a deserted mole-hill, sometimes in the grass, or
corn, like the lark&#8217;k. It breeds twice in the year, each time laying five
or six eggs, grey-blue, spotted all over with reddish grey, and very like
those described above. The under parts of the young birds are much
paler than in the old ones. They must be reared on ants&#8217; eggs and white
bread soaked in boiled milk.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mode of Taking.</span>&mdash;These birds are not very easily caught; at least,
I have always found it very difficult to succeed; and, therefore, one is
reduced to the necessity of placing limed twigs on the nest, which is cruel.
If snow should fall, however, after their return in spring, some of them
may be taken, by clearing a convenient place, and scattering there meal-worms
amongst limed twigs, if you succeed in bringing the birds near.</p>

<p class="center">Motacilla &OElig;nanthe, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; L'&OElig;nanthe, ou Le Culblanc, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Der
Weisschwanz, <span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> bird, found throughout Europe and the northern parts
of Asia, resembles the wagtail in size and air; but its tail
being only an inch and ten lines, its total length is only five
inches and a half. The beak, seven lines long, is black, as
well as the iris and feet; the shanks are an inch high; the
forehead white, and a white streak passes above the eyes,
crossed by a black line springing from the nostrils, which also
tints the cheeks; all the upper parts of the body and the
scapulars are of a light ash-grey colour, slightly tinged with a
reddish hue.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span></p>

<p>The back of the female is reddish grey, and the under parts
of the body darker than in the male; the lesser wing-coverts
are edged with rust-red, and the white of the tail is not so
clear as in the male, but is of a reddish tint.</p>

<p>The young ones, before moulting, are spotted with red on a
dark brown ground, on the upper part of the body; on the
under speckled with orange and black. After moulting, both
males and females retain for another year the colour of the
female on the back, that is to say, reddish grey.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Habitation.</span>&mdash;When wild this species frequents stony and mountainous
places; and, during their migration, they may be seen resting in the fields,
on the tops of isolated stakes, and other similar places; rarely on trees or
bushes. They take their departure during the first fortnight in September,
and return towards the middle of April, when white frosts cease.</p>

<p>In the house these birds must be kept in nightingales&#8217; cages, or shut up
behind a grating, and not suffered to range until accustomed in their prison
to their new food; for, unless taken good care of at first, they will soon
die. They can rarely be tamed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Food.</span>&mdash;When wild they feed on flies and other insects, which they
catch as they run along.</p>

<p>In the house they must be given plenty of meal-worms and ants&#8217; eggs
as soon as they are taken; for, if not fed profusely, they will die, and
what is rather astonishing, of diarrh&oelig;a, although they have not eaten any
of the common house-food. Afterwards they may be fed on nightingales'
food, and occasionally on white bread soaked in boiled milk; yet, with
every attention, they can rarely be preserved more than two years.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Breeding.</span>&mdash;Their nests, formed of stalks of grass and feathers, are
generally placed in the crevices of some stone-quarry, sometimes in holes
on the banks of streams or rivers, or in an empty mole-hill, or even on a
heap of stones. They lay from five to six eggs, of a greenish white. To
rear the young ones, they must be taken when half-fledged, and fed on
ants&#8217; eggs and white bread soaked in boiled milk.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mode of Taking.</span>&mdash;Limed twigs must be placed on the stones or stakes
where these birds rest, or even on sticks fixed in the ground for the purpose,
and they must be driven gently towards the snares.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attractive Qualities.</span>&mdash;No one would take the trouble to tame a
full-grown wheatear, unless passionately fond of keeping birds. I have
one, that, by the use of plenty of fresh ants&#8217; eggs, has been accustomed to
range the room. Its plumage is pleasing, its actions graceful; it is continually
waving and spreading its fine tail. Its song is passable, but is
interrupted every now and then by a kind of scream.</p></div>

<h5>MR. SWEET&#8217;T ACCOUNT OF THE WHEATEAR.</h5>

<p>The present interesting species generally arrives in this
country about the middle of March, and leaves it again the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
latter end of September or the beginning of October, though I
one year saw a pair in Hyde Park as late as the 17th of
November.</p>

<p>In a wild state they are generally to be found on downs and
commons, and in Sussex some hundred dozens are caught
annually by the shepherds, who sell them for the sake of their
flesh, which is very delicious, particularly in autumn, when
they become very fat.</p>

<p>This is a very interesting bird in confinement, and is almost
continually singing; it will also sing by night as well as by
day, if there is a light in the room where it is kept; it has a
very pleasant, variable, and agreeable song, different from all
other birds, which, in confinement, it continues all the winter.
When a pair of them are kept together in a large cage or
aviary, it is very amusing to see them at play with each other,
flying up and down, and spreading open their long wings in a
curious manner, dancing and singing at the same time. I have
very little doubt but a young bird, brought up from the nest,
might be taught to talk, as they are very imitative.</p>

<p>When wild the present species feeds entirely on insects, so
that the more it has given it when in confinement, the better.
There are very few sorts of insects that it will refuse, except
the common earth-worm; small beetles, cockroaches, crickets,
grasshoppers, most sorts of caterpillars, butterflies, moths,
earwigs, woodlice, the common maggots, and almost all other
sorts of insects it is very fond of, and the more that is given
it, the finer will be its song. Its common food is bruised
hemp-seed and bread, intermixed with fresh, raw, lean meat;
also a little of the yolk of an egg boiled hard occasionally for a
change.</p>

<h4>THE WHINCHAT.</h4>

<p class="center">Montacilla Rubetra, <i>Linn&aelig;us</i>; Le Tarier, ou Le Grand Traquet, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Der
Braunkehliger Steinschm&auml;tzer, <span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> is a delicate bird that is met with throughout Europe,
among scattered bushes and abrupt declivities. It is four
inches ten lines in length, of which the tail measures an inch
and a half. The beak is black, as also the legs, which are nine
lines high; the upper parts of the body are dusky, in very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
old birds black, but streaked with pale rust-red, as all the
feathers are edged with this colour; a white line, beginning at
the nostrils, passes above the eyes as far as the ears; the cheeks
are dusky, spotted with chestnut; the throat and breast are
yellow, inclining to orange, the former edged with white on
the sides and chin.</p>

<p>The colours are paler in the female, the streak above the eyes
is yellowish; the upper part of the body dark brown, spotted
with rust; the cheeks dark brown; the throat reddish-white;
the breast pale orange, with small round, black and brown
spots, which gradually disappear from age.</p>

<p>These birds vary till the third year. The young ones, which
may be seen perched on cabbages and other plants, even on
strong wheat stalks, have the whole of the upper part of the
body covered with red and blackish spots, and each feather
edged with this colour before the first moulting; the under
part of the body is like the female. I killed two in their
second year, that still had dusky spots on the breast, though
they had become darker on the back; in general, the two
sexes may be distinguished by the deep brown of the cheeks
and back.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Habitation.</span>&mdash;When wild they generally frequent the skirts of woods.
They appear amongst us the beginning of May, and depart towards the end
of September. In August they may be seen scattered over the fields, on
the stalks of plants, or detached bushes.</p>

<p>In the house they must be kept in a nightingale&#8217;s cage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Breeding.</span>&mdash;The nest, constructed of dried grass mixed with moss, lined
with hair and feathers, is commonly placed in a tuft of grass in the middle
of a meadow or orchard. The females lay five or six eggs, of a fine light
blue. Young ones reared on ants&#8217; eggs succeed much better than those
taken full grown.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mode of Taking.</span>&mdash;In spring, when some of these birds are seen in a
field or meadow, sticks, furnished with limed twigs, should be stuck there,
and the birds gently driven to that side, to induce them to settle, which
they will soon do. In summer, the noose, spring-trap, and limed twigs,
must be employed in the following manner:&mdash;If the noose is used, a stake
must be set up, about three feet high, slit at the top to put in crossways a
stick three inches long, and the noose is placed an inch and a half above, to
be of the height of the bird&#8217;s breast when it is perched on the stick.</p>

<p>If limed twigs are used, forked switches three feet long should be
employed: the fork, four inches in length, must be covered with bird-lime.
Spring-traps or gins must be suspended to small stakes or cabbage stalks.
As soon as a sufficient number of these spring-traps, snares, and limed
twigs, are prepared, they must be carried to a cabbage garden, when a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>number of these whinchats has been seen; there fix the stakes in cross
lines, two or three paces apart; then go to the end of the garden and drive
the birds gently towards the snares; they jump from one cabbage stalk to
another till they approach the stakes; then you stop, and in a short time
the birds are caught one after another. When they are caught, the prisoners
must be taken out and the snares arranged again; then go to the
other end and again drive the birds forward as before, and thus continue
till the sport is over.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attractive Qualities.</span>&mdash;However gay this bird may appear when free,
it becomes sad and melancholy in the house. If permitted to range, it
only moves to procure food, and then returns to its accustomed place, and
keeps its head sunk on its breast. Its pleasing song very much resembles
the goldfinch&#8217;h; but what makes it more admired, is, that it is not only
heard during the day, but also in the evening, and sometimes during
the night.</p></div>

<h5>MR. SWEET&#8217;T ACCOUNT OF THE WHINCHAT.</h5>

<p>This pretty species is also known by the name of Furze
Chat, and is very often confounded with the stonechat, which
is a very different species. It generally visits this country in
the beginning of April, and leaves us towards the end of September.
All the fore part of the season it visits commons,
where it may be seen on the furze bushes, flying backwards
and forwards after the insects that pass. It builds its nest on
the ground in a thicket, which it covers up with dry grass, so
that it is impossible to find it without watching the old ones,
either in carrying materials to build, or food to their young.
I have generally found them with six or seven young ones,
which, with care, are easily bred up from the nest, keeping
them warm, dry, and clean, and feeding them with the same
sorts of food as recommended for the old ones; they should not
be taken till quite fledged, and should at first be placed in a
little basket with covers, as they will then readily open their
mouths for food. I consider those reared from the nest much
the best, or such as are caught very young, as they may then be
taught any tune, or will learn the song of any bird they hear,
their own song not being a very good one.</p>

<p>This bird may be considered as one of the tenderest of the
tribe, being very susceptible of cold. It is one of my greatest
favourites. One that I bred from the nest by hand, learnt the
song of the white-throat, the redstart, willow-wren, nightingale,
and also that of a missel-thrush, which it frequently heard singing
in a garden near by; of this latter song it was so fond, that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
we were frequently obliged to put our favourite out of the room,
not being able to bear its loud notes; it was certainly the best
bird I ever kept of any kind, singing nearly the whole year
through, and varying its song continually; the only fault was
its strong voice. At last, our favourite was turned out of its
cage by a mischievous servant on a cold winter day, when we
were from home for about an hour, and we could not entice it
back; it most probably died of the cold, or took its flight to a
warmer region. I scarcely entertain any hopes of ever getting
such another; the food of the present species is precisely the
same as the last.</p>

<h5>MR. SWEET&#8217;T ACCOUNT OF THE STONECHAT.</h5>

<p>This, like the preceding, is generally to be found on hills
and commons, harbouring chiefly amongst the furze bushes,
and feeds, as far as I have observed, entirely on insects. It is
not so tender as the whinchat, some few of them occasionally
stopping in this country all the winter. It feeds, when wild,
on small beetles, flies, as also all sorts of butterflies, moths, caterpillars,
woodlice, and various other insects.</p>

<p>In confinement their food must be the same as the whinchat&#8217;s.
They soon become very tame, and if bred up from the nest
will learn the notes of other birds, which are in general better
than their own. Their own song, though loud, is very short,
but they have a strong voice to repeat the notes of another
bird.</p>

<h4>THE WHITE-THROAT.</h4>

<p class="center">Sylvia cinerea, <span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>; Le Fauvette grise ou Grisette, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Die gemeine
Grasm&uuml;cke, <span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> bird is five inches and a half in length, of which the
tail measures two and three-quarters. The beak, five lines<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
long, is dusky above and greyish beneath, with the corners and
interior of the throat yellow; the iris is greyish brown; the
shanks are brownish flesh-coloured, and ten lines high; the
head is ash-grey: the cheeks, neck, back, rump, tail-coverts
and lesser wing-coverts, are also ash-grey, but tinged with
brown, deeper on the back than elsewhere; the throat and
belly are fine white.</p>

<p>The female, rather smaller and lighter, rust-coloured on the
wings, has not a fine white throat like the male.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Habitation.</span>&mdash;When wild the white-throat is spread through Europe.
They leave us the beginning of October, and are then observed to retire
from bush to bush, and from hedge to hedge. They reappear towards the
middle of April, fluttering about the bushes in the fields, the brambles,
thickets, underwood of the low mountains, and the orchards, running
about very swiftly.</p>

<p>In the house they must be treated in the same manner as the fauvette;
but they are much more delicate. An amateur had better rear young
birds, and treat them like nightingales. It is the only way to keep them
many years.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Food.</span>&mdash;When wild these birds are constantly seeking among the bushes
for all kinds of insects, grubs, and especially small caterpillars. When,
from the air becoming cooler, the supply of this sort of food lessens, they
immediately substitute for it currants, cherries, and elderberries.</p>

<p>In the house they must be fed, as we said before, on nightingales&#8217; food.
They may, however, be given, occasionally, barley meal and white bread
soaked in boiled milk; but this food alone will not agree with them, for
they will upon it gradually lose their feathers, till at length they become
quite bare. It is a good thing in summer to give them elderberries, though
they may be red, and in winter dried ones, after soaking them in water.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Breeding.</span>&mdash;The nest is formed of small grass stems and moss, and
lined with horse-hair. It is placed in a thick bush, near the ground, or
among roots at the water side, sometimes even in tufts of grass. The eggs,
from four to six in number, are greenish white, spotted with olive green,
and speckled at the large end with dark ash-grey. The young leave the
nest so soon that it is difficult to take them from it. Their first plumage
resembles full-grown ones, and the females may be known by the fainter
tint of fawn brown with which the wing-feathers are edged. I have reared
them easily on ants&#8217; eggs. They soon learn to peck alone, and are
tolerably satisfied with bread soaked in boiled milk; but to keep them
long in health they must be fed in the same manner as the nightingale.
They are pretty, engaging birds, thus reared, becoming so tame that they
will perch and sing on the finger.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diseases.</span>&mdash;These are the same as those of the blackcap, which may be
referred to.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mode of Taking.</span>&mdash;The easiest way is to place limed twigs on the
nest, but this is repugnant to persons not cruel. Towards the end of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>summer, spring-traps may be set, with elderberries and gooseberries hung
near them. It is difficult to take these birds at the water-trap.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attractive Qualities.</span>&mdash;This bird, gay, lively, and constantly in
motion, is a pleasing object in the country. Its song, prolonged far into
the night, consists of several strains, which rapidly succeed each other, but
must be near for all its beauties to be distinguished, since the soft low
tones are only occasionally interrupted by louder notes, which are shrill
and follow quickly one after the other. The bird rises in the air as it
sings, as if to be better heard, circles round as it ceases, and sinks again
into its bush. Its call is a loud <i>tze</i>. When the white-throat is alone in
a room, its song appears very melodious.</p></div>

<h5>MR. SWEET&#8217;T ACCOUNT OF THE WHITE-THROAT.</h5>

<p>This is one of the most delightful and pleasing birds that can
be imagined. If kept in a large cage with other birds it is
so full of antics, in flying and frisking about, and erecting its
crest, generally singing all the time, certainly nothing can be
more amusing. It is also quite as hardy as the blackcap,
and if a good one be procured, it is little inferior in song:
but in this they vary considerably, the wild ones as well as
those in a cage. I have now one in my possession that I have
had about eleven years, in as good health, and singing as well as
ever; and certainly no song need be louder, sweeter, or more
varied. It is of the same temper as a nightingale, never suffering
itself to be outdone. It will indeed sing for hours together
against a nightingale, now in the beginning of January, and it
will not suffer itself to be outdone; when the nightingale
raises its voice, it also does the same, and tries its utmost to get
above it; sometimes in the midst of its song it will run up to the
nightingale, and stretch out its neck as if in defiance, and whistle
as loud as it can, staring it in the face; if the nightingale attempts
to peck it, away it is in an instant flying round the aviary, and
singing all the time.</p>

<p>In a wild state, the present species is generally to be found
in hedges and gardens, and is the most common of our British
warblers, visiting us the beginning or middle of April, and
leaving us towards the end of September; sometimes a solitary
one may be seen in October, but not frequently. It is particularly
fond of flies, or a rose-branch covered with aphides will
please it very much.</p>

babillarde, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Das M&uuml;llerchen, <span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> bird somewhat resembles the white-throat, but is
smaller, and has less rust colour on the wings. It is five inches
long, the tail measuring more than two. The beak is five
lines in length, very pointed, black above, and bluish below;
the iris has two rings, the outer one pale yellow, the inner a
brilliant golden yellow; the shanks, seven lines high, are raven
black; the head and rump are dark ash grey; the rest of the
upper part of the body is grey, with a reddish tint; the cheeks
and the part behind the ears are darker than the head; the
throat and under part of the body are white, but the sides of
the breast are tinged with reddish grey, and those of the belly
with reddish brown.</p>

<p>The birds must be before you to be able to distinguish the
two sexes; you can then only perceive that the head of the
female is of a lighter colour, and the feet rather blue than
black.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Habitation.</span>&mdash;When wild this species is found throughout Europe, except
the north. It is common in the hedges in Germany, disappearing
in September, and returning the middle of April. Its taste for currants
often draws it to the garden hedge. It is not very often seen in young
coppice wood, scarcely ever on trees<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">97</a>, continually on low bushes.</p>

<p>In the house it must be lodged like the fauvette, and taken the same
care of; it is so delicate, that when taken rather old it can rarely be preserved.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Food.</span>&mdash;When wild it is the same as the preceding species.</p>

<p>In the house these birds cannot be kept long, unless fed on nightingales'
food, mingled with ants&#8217; eggs and meal-worms.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Breeding.</span>&mdash;The nest is generally found on a thick gooseberry bush, or
white-thorn, and on young fir trees in fir woods. It is formed of coarse
dried grass, lined with small roots mixed with hogs&#8217; bristles. There are
five or six eggs, white, spotted at the large end with grey and yellow brown
in a circle. The female&#8217;s attachment to her brood may be known from
her dropping from her nest almost fainting as soon as any one approaches,
uttering anxious cries, fluttering on the ground, and slowly retiring from
the nest. Scarcely are the young ones fledged, when, if looked at, they
will dart like an arrow from the nest, and run and hide themselves among
the bushes. If you wish to rear them, they must be taken as I have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>directed for the fauvette, remembering that the male and female cannot
then be distinguished.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diseases.</span>&mdash;These are the same as in the fauvettes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mode of Taking.</span>&mdash;If snow should fall after their return, a place near
a hedge should be cleared, and limed twigs fastened to the lower branches;
after having thrown meal-worms there, the birds should be gently driven
towards it, and for the sake of the worms they will creep under the limed
twigs, and remain caught.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attractive Qualities.</span>&mdash;Though the plumage is not very striking, yet
this bird is very pretty. Some clacking tones, rather like the noise of a
mill, have given it in Germany the name of the <i>little Miller</i>; as these
notes are heard more distinctly than the others, they are erroneously thought
to be its whole song; but the rest, certainly very weak, is so soft, so varied,
so melodious, that it surpasses other warblers. Whilst singing in this
under tone it is continually hopping about the bushes, but when going to
utter <i>clap, clap</i>, it stops and employs the whole strength of the larynx to
pronounce this syllable. To enjoy the beauty of its song it should be alone
in a room, and then no other singing bird is more agreeable, as it rarely
utters its call.</p></div>

<h5>MR. SWEET&#8217;T ACCOUNT OF THE BABILLARD.</h5>

<p>This is a handsome, little, lively species, more elegant and
smaller than the white-throat, and of a purer colour; its throat
being as white as snow. It generally visits us the beginning or
middle of April, and leaves us again the end of August or
beginning of September. Its song is not so agreeable as most
of the other species of warblers; but it is soft and pretty, and
very different from any other. It is also more valuable by
being much more rare; some seasons very few visit us, in
others they are sufficiently plentiful. Its habits are somewhat
similar to those of the white-throat, but it is much more quarrelsome,
sometimes so much so, that it must be taken from the
other birds or it will worry them to death, even if they are
double its size.</p>

<p>In confinement it will soon become tame and familiar, and
will readily take to feed on bread and milk, and also on bruised
hemp-seed and bread. One that I bred up from the nest
became so attached to its cage, that it could not be prevailed
upon to quit it for any length of time. When the door of it
was set open, it would generally come out quickly, and first
perch on the door, then mount to the top of the cage, thence
it would fly to any other cages that were in the room, and
catch any flies that came within its reach; sometimes it would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
descend to the floor, or perch on a table or chair, and would
fly up and take a fly out of the hand, or drink milk out of a
spoon if invited: of this it was very fond. As soon as it was
the least frightened, it would fly immediately to its cage, first
on the top, thence to the door, and would enter in exactly as
it came out. I have often hung it out at the window perched
on the top of its cage, with the door open, and it would never
attempt to fly away. Sometimes if a fly should happen to
pass near it, it would fly off and catch it, and return with it to
the top of the cage: after remaining there a considerable time,
it would either return into it, or fly in at the window, and
perch on the cages of the other birds. It is rather more tender
than the white-throat.</p>

<h5>MR. BLYTH&#8217;H ACCOUNT OF THE BABILLARD.</h5>

<p>The warble of the babillard (<i>Curruca garrula</i>, Brisson) is
pretty and lively, but its song is rendered monotonous in the
spring and summer by the constant repetition of its loud note
of defiance, analogous to the clear lively note with which the
blackcap generally concludes: this may be expressed by the
monosyllable <i>see</i>, repeated nine or ten times in quick succession,
and at times very loudly: it is a note, which, though
agreeable enough when only heard occasionally, becomes quite
tiresome when continually reiterated. This species, however,
can warble very sweetly if it please, and, in confinement,
during the first months of the year, its song is heard to great
advantage in a room; it then rarely repeats its loud <i>see see
see</i>, and when, at that time, the above-mentioned note is uttered,
it forms, indeed, an agreeable variety. The song of the babillard
is formed of a number of soft chirping notes, many of which
are extremely sweet and musical, and though at times tolerably
loud, yet they are generally delivered in a very low tone,
scarcely audible at a little distance. The male is almost perpetually
singing, erecting his crest and the feathers of his throat
in the manner of a white-throat, and, like that species and the
furze warbler, he is in constant motion the whole time, throwing
himself into a variety of odd gesticulations. The song of this
bird is very superior to that of many white-throats, but not to
all; he has none of those harsh sounding notes which so often
disfigure the white-throat&#8217;s song. He seems also to be always<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
in such high spirits as not to know how to contain himself,
taking frequently a long circuitous flight from tree to tree, and
back again, a dozen times, seemingly for no other purpose than
mere exercise; but he never mounts singing into the air, like
the white-throat. There are yet many persons, I believe, who
consider this species to be &#8220;a mere variety&#8221; of the white-throat.
These two species differ from each other in size, in make, in
colour, in their manners, their habits, their song, in the structure
of their nest, and in the marking of their eggs; and surely,
&#8220;if all these circumstances (as Wilson observes, after making
similar remarks on two American birds, one of which had been
considered a &#8216;bastard&#8217; production of the other) be not sufficient
to designate this (the babillard) as a distinct species, by what
criterion, I would ask, are we to discriminate between a <i>variety</i>
and an <i>original species</i>, or, to assure ourselves, that the great
horned owl is not, in fact, a <i>bastard</i> goose, or the carrion crow
a mere <i>variety</i> of the humming bird?&#8221;</p>

<h4>THE BLACK REDSTART.</h4>

<p class="center">Motacilla Tithys, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>: Le Rouge-queue, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Der Wistling, <span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Length</span> five inches and one quarter, of which the tail alone
measures two and one quarter. The beak is five lines long,
very pointed and black, the inside and corners yellow; the iris
is dusky; the shanks are nine lines high, and black; the upper
part of the body is dark bluish, or blackish gray; the rump is
red; the cheeks, throat, and breast, are black; the belly and
sides are of the same dark colour as the back, but tinged with
white; the vent is reddish yellow.</p>

<p>The upper part of the body in the female is dusky ash grey;
the under part ash grey, with a reddish tinge.</p>

<p>The colours of this bird vary during the first eight years;
the oldest ones, with the exception of the tail and wings, are
in general black, but deeper on the under part than the upper;
the very oldest have a greyish breast.</p>

<p>Those a year or two old very much resemble the females,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
having the upper part of the body ash grey, but the under
rather more of a reddish colour; the quill-feathers have a more
decided border. After two years the depth of the colour
gradually increases. Several bird-catchers, and from them
some authors, have considered these birds of different ages as
different species.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Habitation.</span>&mdash;In its wild state the black redstart is found in the temperate
parts of Europe and in Asia in the same latitudes<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">98</a>. They seem to
prefer mountainous districts to wide plains, and they are seen in great
numbers on bare chalk-hills; if found in woods, it is only in those that are
on rocks. They frequent towns and villages, perching on the highest
buildings, towers, steeples, churches, and castles<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">99</a>. In spring and autumn
it hops about the hedges. It arrives early in the spring, its song is heard
in the beginning of March, and it quits us in small flights towards the
middle of October. It possesses one quality, not common among singing
birds, that of singing all the year, or, at least, whilst in our country, however
cold and stormy the weather may be.</p>

<p>In the house it should be kept in a nightingale&#8217;s cage, or at least not
permitted to range the room.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Food.</span>&mdash;When wild it feeds on flies, drawn by the warmth of spring from
their retreat, and settled on walls; afterwards on cabbage caterpillars and
other insects, and in autumn on berries.</p>

<p>In the house they may be kept in health a long time, if the above
insects are procured for them, or if fed on nightingales&#8217; food, adding occasionally
ants&#8217; eggs and meal-worms.</p>

<p>Old birds taken in autumn may sometimes be tamed and accustomed
to eat the common food in the room, by putting amongst elderberries, in
autumn, ants&#8217; eggs, and meal-worms at other seasons. They have been
known to live five or six years in a cage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Breeding.</span>&mdash;This bird makes its nest in the holes of rocks and walls,
particularly in high buildings, on the timbers of barns, and places it at a
distance from any other. It is constructed of hay, mixed with the hair of
animals. Each laying (for there are two in the year) consists of five or six
white eggs. The young have a reddish grey plumage, and should be taken
from the nest when the tail is half grown, if it is wished to rear them.
They should be fed on ants&#8217; eggs, and white bread soaked in boiled milk.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diseases.</span>&mdash;These are the same as those of the fauvette.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mode of Taking.</span>&mdash;Limed twigs, with meal-worms fastened to them,
should be laid wherever these birds are most frequently found. Towards
winter they may be caught in spring-traps with elderberries hung opposite.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attractive Qualities.</span>&mdash;Its call, &#8220;<i>fitza</i>,&#8221; being very similar to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>nightingale&#8217;e, has given rise most probably to its name of Wall Nightingale,
which it has in common with the following species. Its song certainly
cannot enter into comparison with that of the nightingale, for it is sad,
and consists of only three strains, the middle one scarcely more than
croaking; the other two may boast of a few high clear tones; it may be
heard from early in the morning till night. It is always gay and active,
its motions light and nimble; it shakes its tail quickly from side to side at
every hop or spring, and utters continually the cry &#8220;<i>fitza<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">100</a>!</i>&#8221;</p></div>

<h4>THE COMMON REDSTART.</h4>

<p class="center">Motacilla Ph&oelig;nicurus, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; Le Rossignol de muraille, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Das
Gemeiner oder Garten-Rothschw&auml;nzchen, <span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Its</span> length is five inches and a quarter, of which the tail
measures two and a quarter. The beak is five lines, the tip
is blunt, black on the outside, yellow within and at the
corners; the iris is black; the shanks are of the same colour,
and ten lines high; the base of the upper mandible and cheeks
are black, as also the throat, but this is speckled with white;
the white on the front of the head unites with a streak of the
same colour, which extends above the eyes; the back of the
head and neck, the back and lesser wing-coverts, are dark ash
grey tinged with a reddish colour; the rump, breast, and sides,
are red inclining to orange.</p>

<p>The female is very different, very much resembling that of
the black redstart, yet its colours are rather lighter. The
upper part of its body is reddish ash grey; the whitish throat
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>is not clouded with black till the fifth or sixth year; the
breast is dusky rust-red waved with white; the belly is dusky
white; the rump is reddish yellow<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">101</a>.</p>

<p>It is not till after the first moulting that the distinction
between the plumage of the males and females is obvious;
even then the breast of the male retains the black tinged with
white, but loses this tint in the course of the following summer;
the males also have for some time a white streak on the forehead,
that passes above the eyes, and the belly is more white
than rust-red.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Habitation.</span>&mdash;In a wild state these birds are found in Europe and Asia,
and are very common in Germany and England. They leave us the
beginning of October, and return the end of March or beginning of April.
At this time and in autumn they haunt hedges and bushes; but in summer
they principally frequent gardens, the banks of streams planted with
willows, and even forests. Those that frequent gardens also enter towns,
and will perch on the roofs of the houses, enlivening the inmates with their
song from morning till night.</p>

<p>In the house, if given a cage, it should be of such light wire work as not
to conceal the beauty of the plumage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Food.</span>&mdash;When wild they feed on all kinds of insects, earth-worms,
currants, and elderberries.</p>

<p>In the house, if taken in autumn, they may sometimes be induced to
feed on elderberries, rarely on the poultry paste. To entice them to this
meal-worms must be mixed with it at first, and some thrown in when it is
eaten; ants&#8217; eggs must be added in spring. These birds are delicate, and
always require to be supplied with insects; but never give them earth-worms,
as they do not digest them easily. If kept in cages they should be
given nightingales&#8217; food; yet fed in this way it is rare to preserve them
above three or four years; they generally die of consumption or atrophy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Breeding.</span>&mdash;The redstart generally places its nest in a hole of a tree
or wall; it is negligently formed of moss, stalks of grass, feathers, and
hair. The female has two broods in the year, and each time she lays
from five to seven eggs, of an apple green. Scarcely have the tail-feathers
begun to grow ere the young ones hop from the nest and perch on some
neighbouring branch, where they receive food from the parent birds till
they are able to seek it for themselves. Their plumage before moulting
is ash grey spotted with white. The young females resemble the nightingale
so much in autumn that they are often mistaken for it. Bird-fanciers
should rear these birds on ants&#8217; eggs, with white bread soaked in boiled
milk occasionally, and thus accustom them to the common universal paste.
They learn to repeat parts of the songs of their companions.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diseases.</span>&mdash;Diarrh&oelig;a and atrophy carry off the greatest number.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mode of Taking.</span>&mdash;Sticks covered with bird-lime should be placed
across the hedges frequented by these birds; they must then be driven
gently towards them. They are also attracted under nets, and amongst
limed twigs baited with meal-worms. In autumn they may be taken in
nooses, by suspending elderberries near them, either in orchards or thickets.
Those intended for the house should be taken in bird-traps or springes,
taking care that the wooden part be covered with felt or cork, to prevent
the legs being broken. The young ones of the first year are the easiest to
preserve. They also go to the water-trap without difficulty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attractive Qualities.</span>&mdash;Its plumage, and still more its song and
sprightliness, render this a delightful bird. It is always in motion, bowing,
and moving its tail from side to side at every step; all its actions are
lively and graceful. It can improve its song, composed of some very
pretty strains, by adding to it parts of the songs of birds that are found
near it. For instance, those that build under my roof imitate tolerably
the chaffinch that hangs in a cage at my window; and a neighbour of mine
has one in his garden that repeats some strains of a blackcap that has its
nest near. This facility in appropriating the song of other birds is rare
in birds that live in a state of liberty, and seems peculiar to this species.
They become so tame that they will take meal-worms from the hand.</p></div>

<h5>MR. SWEET&#8217;T ACCOUNT OF THE REDSTART.</h5>

<p>This is one of the handsomest of our British birds, visiting
us the latter end of March or beginning of April; the earliest
arrival ever noticed was the 25th of March, and they generally
leave us the beginning of September. When they first arrive
they mostly frequent old buildings or out-houses, for the sake
of flies and small insects that often abound there. They build
their nest in a hole or crevice of a wall, or in a hollow tree.
They frequently ascend to the top of the highest tree within
their haunt, and there sit sometimes for a considerable time,
pouring out their quick and sort of fretful song. When kept
in confinement I consider it the most sensible, and, if brought
up from the nest, the most attached of all small birds; but it
may be considered the most tender of the whole tribe. It is
a real mocker, and if bred up from a young one, will learn the
note or call of almost any other bird; it will also learn a tune
that is whistled or sung to it, and will sing by night as well as
day if a light be kept in the room where it is.</p>

<p>I was in possession of a handsome male bird of this species,
which I kept more than six years. It became very tame, though
an old wild bird when first caught, and it was so attached<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
to its cage, that one day, having got its liberty, it flew away
into the gardens, where it stayed six or seven hours, after which
it returned to its cage again. In the year 1825 I saw a female
bird of this species so late as the 21st of November, flying
about as lively as at midsummer; it had probably escaped or
been turned out of a cage. When in confinement it is particularly
partial to ants&#8217; eggs, and also to the common maggots.</p>

<h4>THE ARBOUR BIRD.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> pleasing bird, which is met with wherever there are
groves and bushes<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">102</a>, is five inches and a half in length, of
which the tail measures two and a quarter. The beak, seven
lines long, is straight, blunt, bluish grey above, and yellow
tinged with flesh-colour beneath, with yellowish corners, and
the entrance of the throat citron yellow; the iris is dark
brown; the shanks, ten lines high, are lead-coloured. The
head is pointed in front; the back, rump, and lesser wing-coverts,
are olive ash grey; a yellow line extends from the
nostrils to the eyes; the whole of the under part of the body
is a fine light yellow; the tail and wings are dark brown; the
secondary quill-feathers have so wide a white border that it
forms a spot on the closed wings.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Habitation.</span>&mdash;In its wild state it frequents orchards, groves, and
brambles; but with us it seems to prefer small woods that are interspersed
with resinous trees. It arrives the end of April, and quits us as early as
the end of August, before the moulting season.</p>

<p>In the house it is kept in a nightingale&#8217;s cage, in which no change must
be made, still less must another be given it, for it would not survive these
disturbances. It is so delicate, that if taken when full grown it is almost
impossible to tame it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Food.</span>&mdash;When wild its food is all kinds of insects, smooth caterpillars,
flies, gnats, &amp;c.; and if these are scarce, berries<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">103</a>.</p>

<p>In the house it prefers these insects and meal-worms. It is only with
great patience and management that it can be given a taste for the nightingale&#8217;e
food. In general it will eat nothing but insects.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Breeding.</span>&mdash;The nest of the arbour bird is one of those that are so well
and curiously formed, commonly placed eight feet above the ground, in
the fork of a tree. It is built of pieces of the white bark of the birch tree,
dried plants, caterpillars&#8217; webs, wool, and the upper layer of down. All
these white materials give it the appearance of being made of paper. It is
lined with the finest hay. The female lays five eggs, which are at first
of a pale rose red, but after having been sat upon some days acquire a
dark flesh-coloured tint, speckled with dark red. This species has but
one brood in the year, and if the nest is approached two or three times it
will desert it, whether the young ones are hatched or not.</p>

<p>If a person wish to have this pleasing bird in the house, as it is often
seen in Hesse, he must take the young ones early from the nest, feed them
on ants&#8217; eggs and bullock&#8217;s heart chopped small, and always keep them in
a warm place. As soon as the arbour bird has been placed in the situation
destined for it, it must be left there constantly; its cage ought not to be
changed, at least there should be no difference in the one given it afterwards,
as without this attention it becomes sad, eats no longer, and dies in
a short time. I may observe here, that it moults in December or January,
whence we may infer that it passes the winter in a southern climate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diseases.</span>&mdash;These are the same as the nightingale&#8217;e.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mode of Taking.</span>&mdash;This can rarely be accomplished but by placing
limed twigs on the nest, which is a cruel method, and the nest is often
deserted as soon as it has been approached. Neither will these birds go to
the water-trap: they may be caught occasionally in bird-traps in August,
by baiting them with currants<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">104</a>. The surest way then is to take them
young, especially as the old ones cannot be tamed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attractive Qualities.</span>&mdash;The song of the arbour bird is sweet, varied,
full of power and melody, long sustained; yet some harsh strains have
been remarked, and some resembling the notes of the chimney swallow.
Whilst singing its throat is much dilated. Its call is <i>dak, dak! hyovie,
hyovie!</i> Its plumage is pretty.</p></div>

<h5>ACCOUNT OF THE ARBOUR BIRD, FROM THE &#8220;FIELD
NATURALIST&#8217;T MAGAZINE.&#8221;</h5>

<p>&#8220;British writers, since the time of Pennant and White, have
rendered the history of several of our smallest birds a mass of
confusion, which even now it will be difficult to clear up,
though I feel confident I possess the means of loosening two at
least of the knots of the controverted points, as I shall presently
show.</p>

<p>&#8220;When I was residing, in the summer of 1832, at Bonn, on
the Rhine, my friend M. Wichterich brought me a pair of
birds with their young, which at first sight, judging from colour
and size, I took to be pale canaries, till I looked at their bills;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>I perceived then that it was a species with which I was unacquainted,
and certainly not known as British. I was accordingly
not a little surprised when he told me it was the <i>Sylvia
Hippolais</i> of Bechstein, and astonished when he said it was one
of the finest song birds in Europe, very superior to the blackcap
and fauvette, and in some respects even to the nightingale.
I thence concluded that it was the species whose splendid song
had charmed and puzzled me in an orchard at Schiedam, in
Holland, and again in the gardens of Prince Maximilian, at
Neuwied, on the Rhine; the rich intonation and multitudinous
variety of the notes fully bearing out my friend&#8217;s opinion.
This circumstance alone would go far to prove that the species
is not British, for it would be impossible so fine a song bird
could be concealed, particularly as it haunts gardens, and is
rarely found in woods. The very contrary of the statement of
Temminck, whose authority, how high soever it may be in
other matters, is, with respect to habits and field observations,
of not the slightest weight: he might have seen the bird, if he
ever looked beyond his cabinet, in most of the gardens about
Leyden, where he resides.</p>

<p>&#8220;I kept the old birds with their young, which they fed in
a cage for some time, but to my great regret they fell a sacrifice
to the common enemy of cage birds. About the same time
I was delighted to find a nest of the same species in a lilac-tree
in my own garden, about half a dozen yards from my parlour
windows. Three of the young after leaving this nest were
secured, and their mother was caught to feed them, which she
did successfully, and I brought them all, and three others,
home with me to England. The nest was about seven feet
high from the garden level, and ten from the base of a low
wall, over which the branch where it was built leaned. The
workmanship of the nest is very superior to that of the blackcap,
coming nearer in character to that of the finches. The
frame-work is rather thick, made of dried grass stems, sewing
thread, fine wood shavings, birch bark, and small pieces of linen
rag. The inside is very neatly lined with roots, hair, and a
few feathers and small locks of wool.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the full grown male the bill is about half an inch long,
straight, somewhat blunt, broad and flat at the base. The
upper mandible has an exceedingly indistinct notch, and is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
greyish blue; the under mandible yellowish, with a tinge of
red; the angles yellowish, and the opening of the mouth lemon
yellow. The tongue is yellow, abrupt at the point, and furnished
with three bristles. The iris is dusky brown. The
forehead is low, flat, angular, and pointed. The eyebrows
and eyelids are yellow, and a yellow line runs from the nostrils
to the eyes. The crown of the head, neck, back, and
wing-coverts are olive grey, inclining more to green on the
rump. The shoulder of the wing (<i>campterium</i>, <span class="smcap">Illiger</span>) is
yellow: the primary quill-feathers are dusky brown, with a
slight fringe of olive grey; the rest of the quill-feathers have
a broader fringe of greyish white, which, when the wing is
closed, forms a whitish patch. The tail is two inches long,
the feathers being of equal length, and of very nearly the same
colours and tinge as the wing-quills. All the under parts of
the body are of a fine clear lemon colour. The legs are five-sixths
of an inch high, and of a lead colour; the claws greyish
brown. The whole length is five inches and a half; the extent
of the wings nine inches.</p>

<p>The female is sometimes, but not always, rather paler than
the male. The young have the yellow parts very pale.</p>

<p>A species very similar to this has been discovered in Italy
by Prince C. Buonaparte&mdash;the <i>Sylvia icterina</i>? of Vieillot,
which frequents marshy places.</p>

<h4>THE COMMON CHIFF-CHAFF.</h4>

<p class="center">Sylva loquax, <span class="smcap">Herbert</span>; S. Hippolais, <span class="smcap">Montagu</span>; but not the <i>S. Hippolais</i> of the
Continental authors, which is <i>S. polyglotta</i>.</p>

<h5>COLONEL MONTAGU AND MR. SWEET&#8217;T ACCOUNT OF THE
CHIFF-CHAFF.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> bird weighs about two or nearly three drachms; the
length varies from four inches and a half to five inches.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span></p>

<p>This species is nearly the same size as the hay-bird. In its
plumage it so much resembles that bird, that we shall only
make mention here of some essential marks of distinction, and
refer our readers to the hay-bird.</p>

<p>Its general colour is not so much tinged with yellow, and
the legs are dusky, which in the other are brown.</p>

<p>The plumage of the sexes are alike.</p>

<p>These two birds have been, and are, frequently confounded,
and with them the wood wren of this work; but this last is at
once distinguished by the under tail-coverts being a pure white,
and the plumage of a more lively green on the upper parts
than either of the others. The nest, eggs, and notes, will be
found also different by consulting and comparing the history of
each. This is the first of all the migrative warblers (<i>Sylviad&aelig;</i>)
in its annual visit, and is, perhaps, the only one that has occasionally
been observed with us during the winter, and that only
in the milder parts of England. It is generally heard on or
before the first of April repeating its song, if that may be so
called which consists only of four notes, which seem to express
the words <i>chip, chop, cherry, churry</i>, four or five times successively.
It is a busy, restless bird, always active among the
trees and bushes in search of insects. From its early cry in
our neighbourhood, we long suspected it would be found that
this hardy little bird did not wholly quit us, and in this opinion
we were confirmed by seeing one in the garden about Christmas,
1806. In the following January, we observed two of
these little creatures busied in catching the small insects which
a bright day had roused in great abundance about some fir
trees, by springing upon them from the ends of the branches,
one of which we succeeded in shooting. Another, which we
killed in 1808, on the same spot, while feeding upon a small
species of <i>culex</i>, weighed one drachm thirty-three grains; this
will easily account for the very early cry of this bird in the
spring, as it is highly probable that they remain with us the
whole year, but are wholly silent in the winter. The earliest
we ever heard was on the 14th of March, 1804, when vegetation
was unusually early.</p>

<p>The nest of this species is oval, with a small hole near the
top, composed externally of dry leaves, and then coarse dry<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
grass, and lined with feathers; and is generally placed on or
near the ground, frequently on a ditch bank, in a tuft of grass
or low bush. The eggs are six in number, white, speckled
with purplish red at the larger end only, with here and there
a single speck on the sides.</p>

<p>It seems to be the hardiest and most generally diffused of
all our summer visitants; and is found in all parts of the
kingdom where wood or hedges afford it shelter and food. Its
note is heard long after the hay-bird is silent. Dr. Latham
says this is called in Dorsetshire the hay-bird; but as we are
inclined to believe the three species before mentioned have
been confounded, it is more probable that our hay-bird
should obtain that name, as its nest is composed of that
material.</p>

<p>Mr. Sweet tells us, &#8220;it is readily taken in a trap baited
with small caterpillars. They soon get familiar in confinement;
when first caught, they should, if possible, be put with
other birds, and they will readily take to feed on bruised
hemp-seed and bread, and on bread and milk, which must at
first be stuck full of small insects, or a quantity of aphides
may be shaken off a branch upon it; when they have once
tasted it they will be very fond of it. One that I caught took
to eat it directly, and became so familiar, that in three or four
days it would take a fly out of the hand. It also learnt to
drink milk out of a tea-spoon, of which it was so fond, that it
would fly after it all round the room, and perch on the hand
that held it, without showing the least symptoms of fear.
It would also fly up to the ceiling, and bring down a fly in its
mouth every time. At last it got so very tame, that it would
sit on my knee by the fire and sleep; and when the windows
were open, it would never attempt, nor seemed to have the
least inclination, to fly out; so that I at last ventured to entice
it out in the garden, to see whether it would return. I with
difficulty enticed it out at the door with a spoon of milk; it
returned twice to the room; the third time it ventured into a
little tree; it then fled and perched on my hand, and drank
milk out of the spoon; from thence it flew to the ground on
some chickweed, in which it washed itself, and got into a
holly-bush to dry. After getting among the leaves, I could
see no more of it, but heard it call several times. I suppose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
after it got quite dry that it left the country directly, as I
could never see or hear it afterwards, and it was then the end
of November, when all the others had left for some time<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">105</a>.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> and the gold-crested wren are the smallest of our
European birds.</p>

<p>The full-grown male has the bill a third of an inch in length,
very narrow, and pointed; of a blackish brown, except at the
edges and within, where it is yellow. The iris is dusky brown.
From the base of the bill on each side there runs a narrow
yellowish white streak, and there is another straight streak of
a dusky yellow over the eye. The sides of the head are of a
very clear brown. The upper part of the head, neck, and
back, are greyish brown, with a slight tinge of olive. The
throat is greyish white; the breast light grey, with a very pale
tinge of red, or rather rust brown. The belly is greyish white,
with faint yellowish streaks.</p>

<p>The females and the young males, before the first moult,
have the upper parts of a clear olive green, and the under parts
reddish white.</p>

<p>I have never met with the nest; but it is said to be built on
the ground amongst fallen leaves, domed, with a side entrance,
and lined with feathers. The eggs are said to be from four to
seven, white, with reddish black dots, most crowded at the
larger end.</p>

<p>The young branchers may be caught in autumn by means
of the owl, with limed twigs, and fed on ant&#8217;s eggs and small
meal-worms. They will also soon take to bread and milk, or
German paste, and become exceedingly tame, but are very impatient
of cold.</p>

<p>It is most probably a native of Britain, like the preceding;
but is not yet distinctly proved to be so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> species weighs about two drachms and three quarters;

plumage are of a greenish yellow brown: the under parts are
white, tinged with yellow; on the breast are a few yellow
streaks; legs light brown.</p>

<p>This is a plentiful species in some parts; frequents wooded
and enclosed situations, especially where willows abound; is
frequently found with the wood wren, but does not extend so
far to the west in England, as it is rarely met with in Cornwall.
It comes to us early in April, and soon begins its usual song,
which is short, with little variety. About the latter end of
the same month, or beginning of May, it makes a nest of an
oval shape, with a small opening near the top, composed of
moss and dried grass, and lined with feathers. This is placed
in the hollow of a ditch, or in a low bush close to the ground.</p>

<h5>MR. SWEET&#8217;T ACCOUNT OF THE HAY-BIRD.</h5>

<p>This is another little favourite songster, and a most deserving
one it is. It visits us the latter end of March, or beginning of
April, and leaves us again at the end of September, or beginning
of October. On its first arrival, it enlivens our woods and
groves with its lively piercing song and gay frolics, flying
about from tree to tree, and catching the small gnats and flies
that come in its way. It builds its nest on the ground in a
thicket amongst dead leaves and moss, with a covering on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
top, of the same materials as those lying all around, so that it
is impossible to find it without watching one of the old ones to
the nest, which in general consists of six or seven young ones.
These may either be brought up from the nest, or if an old one
be caught wild it is easily tamed. When first put in the cage
with a tame bird, the general food, bread and milk, and eggs,
should be stuck full of small flies, aphides, small caterpillars,
or other small insects, in picking out which it will taste the
other food, and soon take to eat it readily, and will soon become
very tame in confinement. One that I caught in September
was, in three days afterwards, let out of the aviary into the
room to catch the flies, that were numerous at that season.
After amusing itself for some time in catching flies, it began
singing; and it did the same several other times when it was
let out, and in a few days began to sing in its aviary. It soon
became so familiar, that it would take flies out of the hand;
and when out in the room, if a fly was held towards it, would
fly up, and take it immediately.</p>

<p>Although the present species is so small a bird, it is very
courageous, being generally the master of the cage, and as it is
so fine a songster, and almost continually in song, no little bird
can be more desirable in a cage with other birds; its note, when
in full song, being so loud and shrill, that its voice is plainly
heard above the nightingale&#8217;s when both are in full song.</p>

from its resemblance to the hay-bird (<i>Sylvia Trochilus</i>), with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
which it is still frequently confounded. It measures in length
five inches and a half; bill horn-colour; upper mandible bent
at the tip, and rather longer than the under; irides hazel;
nostrils beset with bristles; top of the head, neck, back, and
tail-coverts olive green; throat and cheeks yellow, paler on the
breast; belly and vent of a most beautiful silvery white; through
the eye passes a yellow line; legs rather more than an inch
long, of a horn-colour, claws paler.</p>

<h5>MR. SWEET&#8217;T ACCOUNT OF THE WOOD WREN.</h5>

<p>This elegant and beautiful little species ranks itself amongst
my list of favourites. It visits this country the beginning of
April, and leaves it in August, or the beginning of September.
It is generally to be found in summer amongst tall trees in
woods and plantations, where it is readily detected on its arrival,
by a shrill shaking sort of note that may be heard at a great
distance, and cannot be confounded with any other bird. On
its first arrival it sings the greater part of the day, and continues
its song, more or less, through the summer, except at the time
it is engaged in feeding its young. Its nest is built on the
ground in a thicket amongst moss and dead leaves, so that it is
impossible to find it without watching one of the old ones to the
nest, which is easily done when they have young. They may
either be tamed when old, or reared from the nest, and are not
difficult to be caught when young with a little bird-lime at the
end of a fishing-rod, as may several other species of this interesting
group.</p>

<p>As the present species feeds entirely upon insects when wild,
the greater part of which it catches on the wing, it will be useless
to give it any sort of fruit or berry; but bread and milk,
bruised hemp-seed and bread, with bits of fresh lean meat
cut very small and mixed up in it, will be its general food.
It is also very fond of the yolk of an egg boiled hard, and
crumbled small, or stirred up with the point of a knife that it
may peck it out of the shell as it likes. Sometimes these
birds are apt to get off their other food, and will live on egg
several days; at such a time if a few flies could be procured for
them, it would be the most likely to restore their appetite.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> species is less than the white-throat; length five inches
and a half; weight about three drachms and a quarter. The
bill is dusky above, whitish beneath; irides light hazel. The
whole upper parts of the bird are olivaceous brown; the middle
of each feather dusky, except on the back of the neck, which
gives it a pretty spotted appearance; the tail is much cuneiform,
and the feathers somewhat pointed, which is a very marked and
peculiar character in this species; the outer feather being full
an inch shorter than the middle ones, and nearly rounded at
the tips, the wing remarkably short, reaching very little beyond
the base of the tail; legs very pale brown; claws light-horn
colour; hind claw short and crooked.</p>

<p>In shape, the grasshopper warbler very much resembles the
sedge-bird; is rather inferior in size, and at once distinguished
by its spotted back.</p>

<h5>MR. SWEET&#8217;T ACCOUNT OF THE GRASSHOPPER BIRD.</h5>

<p>The present species is known amongst bird-catchers by the
name of the grasshopper lark, and it was originally placed
amongst the larks by ornithologists, but has been very properly
removed from them by later authors, as it wants the most characteristic
mark of that family, namely, its long claw. It is a
very rare bird in the neighbourhood of London, and I have
never been able to procure but one of them, which I lost the
first winter, by letting it wash too much; in confinement it
requires the same sort of management as recommended for the
two last species, and it will succeed very well. I am not ac<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>quainted
with their song, never having lived in any neighbourhood
where they visit, but I have been credibly informed that
they have none but a note like the chirping of the grasshopper;
this may probably be the case, but I have often heard the
same report of some of our finest songsters, which people had
confused with very common birds, there being very few who
do not confuse, under the general name of white-throats, the
common fly-catcher, both white-throats, the greater pettychaps,
and the blackcaps, when young; and many even confuse with
these the willow wren, wood wren, and lesser pettychaps: this
tribe of birds being only summer visitants, are less known than
any others.</p>

<p>These birds are not uncommon in several parts of England;
they are said to be plentiful on Malmesbury Common, Wiltshire,
in summer, where they breed; they are also frequently seen in
Norfolk and Suffolk, and in various other parts, where they
build their nest among some high grass or sedge, in which it is
so concealed that it is with difficulty found, except by watching
the old birds carrying food to their young ones; or when building,
they may be seen carrying materials to construct their nest.</p>

<p>In a wild state these birds feed entirely on insects, such as
flies, moths, butterflies, spiders, ants; and their eggs, small
beetles, and numerous other sorts, so that in confinement they
will frequently require insect food.</p>

its manner of life with the black-bonnet, or reed bunting
(<i>Emberiza Sch&aelig;niclus</i>, Linn.). It is five inches in length, of
which the tail measures two. The beak, seven lines long,
resembles that of the arbour bird, brown above and yellowish
beneath; the iris is chestnut brown; the shanks are eight
lines high, and ash grey; the forehead is very long, greenish
grey; the rest of the upper part of the body, including the
wing-coverts, are of the same colour, tinged with olive; the
rump is paler; a straw-coloured line extends above the eyes;
the cheeks are olive brown; the under part of the body is
yellowish white; the knees are olive grey; the anterior quill-feathers
are dusky; the secondary are dark brown; all are
edged with olive grey; the tail-feathers have the same colour
as the quill-feathers, but with a wider olive grey border; the
tail is very much rounded, and nearly wedge-formed.</p>

<p>There is little difference in the female. Her head is pale
brown: a white line passes across the eyes; the upper part is
reddish grey, tinged with olive; the under part, except the

quill-feathers are darker brown than the tail, with an olive
grey border.</p>

<p>This is a very variable bird in its colours, some being of a
very pale colour, and others altogether as dark, and those that
are pale one season frequently become dark the ensuing one. It
is a curious little lively bird, known often by the name of reed
wren. It generally makes its appearance with us the beginning
of April, and leaves us in September. Its early or late departure
seems to depend a good deal on the warmth or coolness of the
seasons. It is a very merry bird, almost continually singing,
and will sing by night as well as by day, sitting amongst the
reeds, or in some bush or tree near the water, where it feeds on
the gnats and other insects that infest moist situations. It
is very fond of flies, spiders, small caterpillars, moths, grasshoppers,
crickets, and many other insects, and will swallow a
larger one than could be imagined for so small a bird. In confinement
it will feed readily on the general food, and is also very
fond of the yolk of an egg boiled hard, so that it may be
crumbled on the top of the other food, or put in the cage in an
empty egg-shell. It should also be supplied with a few insects
occasionally, such as flies, spiders, small caterpillars, moths, or
butterflies. Being an inhabitant of the sides of ditches and
rivers, it is very partial to washing, which it must not be
allowed to do in winter, or it will wash itself until it is so weak
that it can never recover.</p>

<h5>MR. SWEET&#8217;T ACCOUNT OF THE SEDGE BIRD.</h5>

<p>In habit and manner the present species approaches to the
former, but is a much handsomer bird; though not so rare, it
frequents the sides of ditches, ponds, and rivers, like the last
species, where it pours forth its variable diurnal and nocturnal
song almost incessantly, on its first arrival in this country,
which is generally the beginning of April, leaving us again
about the middle of September. It builds its nest in a thicket
of reeds, or other tall water-grass, on which it is fastened up
with the webs of caterpillars, similar to that of the former,
which is fastened to the branches of trees, so that no wind or
storm can move it.</p>

<p>The song of the present species is somewhat similar to that
of the last, but is more shrill and chattering; some people
prefer it to that of the latter species, but I do not, as it wants
some fine deep notes that the other possesses: it is also an
imitative bird, its song being intermixed with the call of the
sparrow and parts of the songs of other birds. Its food is
precisely the same as that of the last species; and in confinement
the treatment for both must be exactly alike.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Habitation.</span>&mdash;When wild it is found all over Europe, and particularly
frequents mountainous and woody places. It does not quit us, but remains
in winter, as in summer, near our dwellings.</p>

<p>In the house, on account of its liveliness, it is given rather a large cage,
the bars of which should be very near together. If allowed to range it
may easily escape through small openings, as it is very fond of penetrating
such crevices.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Food.</span>&mdash;At liberty, it consists throughout the year of small insects,
which it seeks in winter in barns, stables, cellars, holes in walls, and piles
of wood. In autumn, however, it will eat both unripe and black elderberries.</p>

<p>As soon as it is brought into the house it must be plentifully supplied
with meal-worms, flies, elderberries, and then gradually add nightingales'
paste, which will soon become its ordinary food. It is only by adopting
this method that I have been successful in preserving one of these birds.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Breeding.</span>&mdash;Any nook appears to suit the wren to build its large nest
in; which may be found in a hole of a tree, amongst the roots, under a
roof, or a cavity under ground; every place is suitable, provided the nest
can be concealed. This is oval, covered with moss on the outside, and
lined with feathers and hair. It has an opening at the top or side to go
in and out by. The female lays from six to eight pretty little white eggs,
speckled with red. The young ones are rusty red, spotted with black and
white. They may be reared on ants&#8217; eggs, adding, as soon as they can fly,
the universal paste; but they always prefer ants&#8217; eggs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mode of Taking.</span>&mdash;If in winter, a white-throat trap is set in a place
much frequented by these birds, and meal-worms scattered within and
around it. In this the wrens will surely be caught. They may be entrapped
in autumn with spring traps and springes, by hanging elderberries
before; but, after every precaution, they generally break their legs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attractive Qualities.</span>&mdash;Its sprightliness is pleasing, and its actions gay
and varied. It has a very powerful voice for its size, and its song is
continued throughout the year; it is soft, and mingled with some notes of
the canary, which are the more pleasing as they consist of distinct loud
tones always descending. Its call is <i>tzrr, tzetzererr!</i> I have never
preserved one more than a year, but other amateurs say they may be
kept two or three.</p></div>

towards the south in October, and return in March; at least, they are
then observed on their passage, in Germany, the hedges being full of them
in spring; but those established among us remain, as they are seen all the
year. They assemble in small flights in winter, and fly about here and
there, like the tits, seeking places where their food is most abundant.</p>

<p>In the house a bell-shaped cage appears to suit them best. Several
may be kept together in a part of a room enclosed with trellis work, and
with a small fir tree for them to perch on. Reared from the nest, they
may be allowed to perch on a tree in the room, which they enjoy so much
that they are never far from it; if there are many they will perch in a row,
press close side by side, and sleep in this manner.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Food.</span>&mdash;In the wild state it feeds on all kinds of small insects and
their grubs; they are, however, able to swallow large flies, as the beak
has a wide opening.</p>

<p>In the house the gold-crests are soon accustomed to the nightingales'
paste, by throwing amongst it at first flies deprived of their wings, or half
dead, and at length they will be satisfied with bruised hemp-seed; but
they must have insects occasionally, flies, meal-worms cut small, ants&#8217; eggs,
&amp;c.; finally, to keep them healthy, their paste should be neither too stiff
nor too moist, and care must be taken to avoid their swallowing rape or
camelin seed, which would immediately kill them<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">106</a>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Breeding.</span>&mdash;The nest, fixed to the extremity of a branch, is round, and
very soft, built of moss, caterpillar&#8217;s cocoons, and tufts of thistle down;
it is generally found in low underwood or meadows with woods adjoining,
on the first tree towards the east. About nine eggs are laid, the size of a
pea, and pale blush red. Those young ones intended to be reared must
not be taken from the nest till they are fledged, and it is best to catch
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>them just as they are leaving the nest. They eat readily meal-worms cut
small, flies, ants&#8217; eggs, and white bread soaked in boiled milk.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mode of Taking.</span>&mdash;As they are not fearful, they may easily be caught
by gently approaching the tree where one is perched, and merely striking
it with a limed twig fastened to a pole long enough to reach it. It may
be brought down also with water, in the manner adopted by M. Le
Vaillant, that is, by first putting into a gun the common charge of powder,
then a wadding of silk, then, as soon as the bird is within reach, two
spoonfuls of water are poured in and covered with a second wadding of
silk, which must not be rammed down hard, lest the water should reach
the powder below. This load, discharged at the distance of twenty paces,
is capable of wetting the bird so completely that it may be taken by the
hand; but if there are hedges in the neighbourhood, or if a stronger bird
be fired at, a chaffinch, for instance, it may easily escape.</p>

<p>Many gold-crested wrens may be caught by means of a hut set for any
small birds, when the way to attract them is known. They come in great
numbers to the water trap, and by their often repeated call of <i>tzitt, tzitt</i>,
give notice of sunset and the arrival of larger birds.</p>

<p>They will soon grow tame enough to eat out of the hand. On account
of their delicacy, many often die before a person succeeds in rearing
one; but when once accustomed to the house they will live a long time,
at least if not hurt by other birds, and if they do not swallow what they
cannot digest.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attractive Qualities.</span>&mdash;The smallness of their size, their elegance and
beauty, render them a pleasant acquisition; but their song adds to their
attractions, for though weak it is very melodious, and resembles that of
the canary.</p></div>

<h5>THE HON. AND REV. W. HERBERT&#8217;T ACCOUNT OF THE
GOLD-CRESTED WREN.</h5>

<p>The golden-crested wren and the common brown wren are
both very impatient of cold. In confinement, the least frost
is immediately fatal to them. In a wild state they keep themselves
warm by constant active motion in the day, and at
night they secrete themselves in places where the frost cannot
reach them; but I apprehend that numbers do perish in severe
winters. I once caught half a dozen golden wrens at the
beginning of winter, and they lived extremely well upon egg
and meat, being exceedingly tame. At roosting time there
was always a whimsical conflict amongst them for the inside
places, as being the warmest, which ended of course by the
weakest going to the wall. The scene began with a low
whistling call amongst them to roost, and the two birds on
the extreme right and left flew on the backs of those in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
centre, and squeezed themselves into the middle. A fresh
couple from the flanks immediately renewed the attack upon
the centre, and the conflict continued till the light began to
fail them. A severe frost in February killed all but one of
them in one night, though in a furnished drawing-room. The
survivor was preserved in a little cage by burying it every
night under the sofa cushions; but having been one sharp
morning taken from under them before the room was sufficiently
warmed by the fire, though perfectly well when
removed, it was dead in ten minutes. The nightingale is not
much more tender of cold than a canary bird. The golden-crowned
wren very much frequents spruce fir trees and cedars,
and hangs its nest under their branches; it is also fond of the
neighbourhood of furze bushes, under which it probably finds
warm refuge from the cold. The brown wren is very apt in
frosty weather to roost in cow-houses, where the cattle keep
it warm.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> characteristics of this bird are so equivocal that it is
sometimes ranked with the larks, sometimes with the starlings,
and sometimes with the <i>Motacill&aelig;</i>. It is six inches and a half
in length, but the tail alone measures nearly three. The beak
is six lines, and is dark brown above and orange beneath; the
mandibles are flattish at the sides; the iris is yellow; the
shanks are an inch high, and pale brown; a whitish ash grey
predominates on the head, neck, and back, but the latter is
streaked with dark brown, the others with pale brown.</p>

<p>The female and young ones are variegated with dark brown
on the belly; the back is dark, and the spots on the throat less
apparent.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Observations.</span>&mdash;This species frequents the secondary mountains of
Switzerland and southern Germany, and is as common there as the field larks
on our plains<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">107</a>. In winter it descends into the valleys, and approaches
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>villages and barns, around which these birds may be caught, in as great
numbers as yellowhammers. They are generally seen on the ground,
running as swiftly as the wagtail, and will sometimes hop on stones, but
rarely perch on trees.</p>

<p>They feed on seeds and insects, and in the house they should be given
bruised hemp-seed, poppy-seed, white bread, and ants&#8217; eggs. On this food
they may be preserved for several years. Their song is sweet, but sad and
melancholy; their attitudes are graceful, and often when they hop they
flutter their wings and tail. They build on the ground or in clefts of
rocks, which has given them the name of rock larks<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">108</a>.</p></div>

<h4>THE OXEYE, OR GREATER TIT<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">109</a>.</h4>

<p class="center">Parus major, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; La grosse M&eacute;sange, ou Charbonni&egrave;re, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Die
Kohlmeise, <span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> well-known bird is five inches and five-sixths in length,
of which the tail measures two and a half. The beak is blackish,
conical, firm, pointed, and without slope, as are the beaks
of the other tits; the iris is dark brown; the shanks are nine
lines high, and lead blue; the claws are sharp, and adapted for
climbing; the upper part of the head is of a brilliant black,
which is joined to the black of the throat by a line of the same
colour that borders and sets off the white of the cheeks and
temples; the nape is greenish yellow, with some mixture of
white; the back is fine olive, and the rump pale ash grey; the
breast and belly are a yellowish green, divided lengthways by
a black line.</p>

<p>The female is smaller, the black on the head and the yellow
on the nape are less bright; the line that runs down the belly
is narrower and shorter, at least it is lost at the part where in
the male it is widest; this marks the difference between young
males and females, which are alike in other respects.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Habitation.</span>&mdash;In its wild state it is found throughout the old world, but
in the greatest numbers in mountainous countries, where orchards and
groves abound, and woods of beech, oak, and similar trees, are found alternately
with those of fir. Though these birds do not migrate, yet in autumn
they assemble and pass the winter together, seeking their food amongst
orchards and woods. In autumn, as soon as the bird-catchers see these
flights of tits succeed each other quickly, they call it their passage, and immediately
prepare snares for taking them. In March each pair separates
and prepares for breeding.</p>

<p>In the house, if kept in a cage, this should be of iron wire, and bell-shaped,
for the advantage of seeing the birds twirl about, and drop from one
stick to another like monkeys. If they be allowed to range, it is necessary
to supply them with abundance of the food they like, for if this fails they
will attack the other birds, and pierce their heads to eat the brain; when
once they have tasted this food there is no longer safety for the birds around
them, whatever their size may be. I have seen an oxeye attack a quail
and kill it in this way. Some bird-catchers say that the tits with forked
tails are alone addicted to this, but they are mistaken; it is certainly true
that some are more cruel than others, experience teaches us this every day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Food.</span>&mdash;When wild they feed on insects, seeds, and berries, destroy many
smooth caterpillars, flies, grasshoppers, gnats, and small butterflies, and
climb about the trees like woodpeckers, seeking in the moss the eggs and
grubs of insects. In autumn and winter they eat all kinds of seeds,
especially hemp-seed, fir, and pine-seed, oats, kernels of fruit, mast nuts,
and occasionally flesh. They hold these things in their claws, tear them
with their beak, and skin them with their tongue.</p>

<p>In the house they will eat any thing on the table, meat, bread, cheese,
vegetables, sweet almonds, walnuts, filberts, lard, and all sorts of fat, all
pastes adapted for other birds; so that we must not attribute their early
death to the delicacy of the tits, but to the want of care in those that have
them. The more they eat the more they sing, and the less inclined they
are to attack their companions. They drink often, and enjoy bathing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Breeding.</span>&mdash;The oxeye builds in a hole of a tree or wall, sometimes in
the forsaken nest of a squirrel, crow, or woodpecker. It lays on an artless
bed of moss, wool, and feathers, eight or ten whitish eggs, sprinkled with
large and small spots mixed with streaks of dark red, particularly at the
large end, where they form a coronet. The young do not quit the nest till
they can fly well. The under parts of the body are pale yellow; and the
black about them is not glossy as in the old birds.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diseases.</span>&mdash;In a cage, this species is subject to vertigo or giddiness,
occasioned by feeding too much on hemp-seed, which heats it and makes it
twirl about too much. To cure the disorder, the bird should be kept for
some time in a small square cage, or permitted to range the room. From
the same cause often arises atrophy, consumption, and even gout, all which
proves the injurious qualities of hemp-seed; but with care on this point
and a little attention it may live eight or ten years.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mode of Taking.</span>&mdash;The chase after tits, is, according to bird-catchers,
one of the most agreeable, and is pursued in many ways; but I shall con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>fine
myself to two or three of the surest methods, specifying the best for
taking those birds that are for the house.</p>

<p>In autumn and spring, the bird-catcher should go into an orchard, or
any other place much frequented by oxeyes, carrying one with him as a
decoy; this must be placed on the ground in a small square cage, and some
sticks, with lime-twigs fastened to them, fixed obliquely around it. The
tits, attracted by curiosity, or the desire of approaching one of their own
species that calls them, quickly descend, and are caught in the lime-twigs.
A whistle made of the bone of a goose&#8217;s leg succeeds still better; with this
instrument all the tits in the neighbourhood are quickly assembled; for
the tone being stronger than the natural call, it is heard farther; if there
are but few of these birds near, they are sure to be all caught.</p>

<p>They are easily attracted, in winter, to a trap, by the kernels of nuts,
lard, and oats. This trap should be placed in a garden, with a little oat
straw fastened under in such a way that it may be seen at a distance, as the
tits are instantly attracted thereby. It is a small box a foot in length, and
eighteen inches in height and width, the sides of which, when not made of
small boards painted green, are formed of small elder sticks, tied or screwed
to the four corner sticks; in this case only two small boards are required,
one for the bottom, the other for the cover, which must be fastened on
with packthread, and turn as with hinges; from the middle of the bottom
rises a peg supporting a cross stick, with a nut kernel at one end, and a
little lard at the other; this cross stick supports a small perpendicular one,
which keeps the cover open three or four inches. When a tit hops on the
cross stick and begins pecking the nut or lard, the cover falls, and the bird
is caught.</p>

<p>The oxeye, like the other tits, assembles in numbers at the water-trap,
commonly from seven to nine in the morning, and from four to five in the
evening.</p>

<p>In autumn these birds are taken in nooses and common bird-traps, baited
with berries, but the snare must be of horse hair, for if of thread, the bird,
as soon as it feels itself caught, will try to bite through it, as mice do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attractive Qualities.</span>&mdash;The sprightliness and activity of these birds
are very pleasing, but their gay and lively song still more so: in it are
agreeably mingled the call &#8220;<i>fick, fick</i>&#8221; and the shrill &#8220;<i>tzizerr</i>.&#8221; Nothing,
in my opinion, is more pleasing than to hear repeated fifteen or twenty
times following these striking notes, &#8220;<i>sitzida, sitzida, stiti, stiti</i>.&#8221; One
may judge of the capability of young ones to imitate the song of other
birds, from the facility with which the full-grown birds learn detached
parts, and particularly different calls.</p>

<p>Some people amuse themselves by making these birds perform many
little man&oelig;uvres, such as drawing up their food with a chain, turning a
cylinder<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">110</a> which has the appearance of being moved by two miners, and
hopping after a nut suspended to a thread.</p></div>

<h4>THE COLE TIT.</h4>

<p class="center">Parus ater, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; La petite Charbonni&egrave;re, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Die Tannenmeise,
<span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> length of this bird is four inches and one-sixth, of which
the tail measures one and three-quarters, and the beak one
quarter. The back is black, with the tip lighter; the iris is
dusky; the shanks are eight lines high, and lead blue; the
upper part of the head and neck are black; there is rather a
broad streak of white at the back of the head and down the
nape of the neck; the cheeks and sides of the neck are also
white, forming, when the bird is at rest, a triangular spot; the
back is dark bluish ash grey.</p>

<p>The female is not easily distinguished from the male, unless
both are before you; its being a little less black on the breast,
and a little less white on the sides, are the only differences.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Habitation.</span>&mdash;When wild these birds are seen in great numbers in pine
forests, and seldom, except during their wanderings in autumn, winter, and
spring, are they met with in other kinds of woods, groves, and orchards.
They often pass from one pine forest to another in large flights during the
winter<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">111</a>. They appear to like the society of the gold-crested wrens, which
are always found in these flights, as also some crested tits, which serve as
guides.</p>

<p>In the house it is pleasanter to allow them to range with the other birds
than to keep them in a cage, yet there is some danger to their companions
from their cruelty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Food.</span>&mdash;When wild, besides insects and their grubs, they feed on the
seeds of different resinous trees; but as they are often deprived of this food
in winter from the trees being loaded with snow and hoar frost, nature has
given them the instinct to provide against this emergency: they hide a
great quantity of these seeds in fissures, and under the large scales of the
bark of pine trees, to which store they have recourse when in want.</p>

<p>The instinct just alluded to is manifested also in the house, even when
they have abundance of all kinds of food; where they are observed to rob
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>the other birds of seeds and bits of nuts, and run and hide them immediately
in any crevices they may find, often visiting these stolen stores
afterwards to see if they are safe. The blue tit and the oxeye are also
accustomed to carry part of their food into a corner, but they do not hide
with so much care, or from the same cause, as the cole tit. These birds
are commonly fed on the universal paste, but they are accustomed to it
with difficulty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Breeding.</span>&mdash;This species generally places its nest either in some hole
deserted by a mole or mouse, or under the overhanging edges of some deep
wheel-rut in an old disused road, rarely in holes of trees or walls. The
nest is composed of a layer of moss covered over with the fur of the hare,
roe-buck, and stag. There are two broods in the year, each of six or eight
white eggs, prettily speckled with pale red. The plumage of the young
differs from that of the old only in having the black duller and less glossy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diseases.</span>&mdash;Decline is the most common disorder of these birds, and it
is sometimes prevented by giving them fresh ants&#8217; eggs, particularly when
moulting. I kept a cole tit six years, and it then died of old age, having
first become blind, and been often attacked with vertigo or giddiness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mode of Taking.</span>&mdash;Less timid and distrustful than the oxeye, this
species may be caught with greater ease. A limed twig fastened to a pole
is often sufficient, with which you approach the tree on which the bird is,
and, touching it with the twig, it becomes your prisoner. Its call is &#8220;<i>tzip
teune</i>.&#8221; Like all the tits, it is delicate, and, in the house, often dies soon
before being accustomed to the common paste.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attractive Qualities.</span>&mdash;This is a very amusing little bird; bold,
lively always in motion, hopping and fluttering about continually. Its
song is only a clashing of harsh tones, relieved by a clear sonorous &#8220;<i>tzifi</i>,&#8221;
repeated twenty times in succession. It sometimes ends, however, with so
reflective an air, that you would think it was going to give something very
fine.</p></div>

dusky, but whitish at the edges and tip; the iris is dark brown;
the shanks are eight lines high, and lead blue; the front of the
head and cheeks are white; a white line passing from the forehead
above the eyes forms a border to the fine sky-blue of the
top of the head; a black line crosses the eyes; the black of
the throat becomes on the sides of the neck a dark blue band,
which surrounds the head.</p>

<p>The female is rather smaller than the male, the streaks about
the head not being so clearly defined, while the blue has the
appearance of being tinged with ash grey. The line down
the under part of the body is scarcely observable.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Habitation.</span>&mdash;These birds, in their wild state, frequent woods, particularly
those of beech and oak. During autumn and winter they wander
from one place to another, and are often seen in considerable numbers in
our orchards.</p>

<p>In the house they may be kept in a cage like the oxeye; but it is preferable
to let them hop and flutter about at pleasure, as their plumage is then
seen to the greatest advantage. They are as mischievous and quarrelsome
as the oxeye, and pursue the other birds in the same manner, even killing
them when they are strong enough.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Food.</span>&mdash;When wild they feed on insects and their grubs, and in autumn
on berries<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">112</a>.</p>

<p>In the house they should be given the same food as the oxeye, accustoming
them to it at first by mixing bruised hemp-seed with it. They like to
wash themselves.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Breeding.</span>&mdash;The nest, placed at the top of a tree in an old hollow
branch, is built of moss, hair, and feathers. This species lays from eight to
ten reddish white eggs, speckled and spotted with brown. The plumage
of the young birds differs from that of the older ones, only in being less
bright and glossy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diseases.</span>&mdash;Most of these birds that are caught in winter, are attacked
with vertigo, or giddiness, after being in the house a few days, fall to the
right and left, and being unable to find their food, soon die.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mode of Taking.</span>&mdash;They may be caught in the same way as the oxeye.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attractive Qualities.</span>&mdash;The blue tit is easily tamed, and lives two or
three years. Its beauty and activity are more attractive than its song,
which is merely an indistinct warbling, composed of a few strains, amongst
which some higher notes are occasionally introduced.</p></div>

<p>In the house they should be allowed to flutter and hop about freely;
they are very delicate, and require a great deal of care at first.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Food.</span>&mdash;When wild, they feed on insects, seeds, and elderberries,
according to the season.</p>

<p>In the house they eat the same things as other tits; but at first, ants'
eggs and elderberries must be added. The seeds of the sunflower (<i>Helianthus
major</i>) have succeeded best with me, and preserved them in health
longest. They will also eat hemp-seed and oats.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Breeding.</span>&mdash;They lay ten or twelve rusty white eggs, spotted with
reddish yellow, in a hole of a tree, on a bed of moss, hair, and feathers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mode of Taking.</span>&mdash;In winter they will easily enter a trap baited with
nut kernels or oats. A surer method is, to lay limed twigs on a sunflower
plant, the seeds of which are ripe. If these tits do not enter the garden,
a plant must be carried to a place much frequented by them. When once
these birds have tasted these seeds, they appear quite contented in the
house. It is only necessary to supply them freely; they will seize them
eagerly directly after being taken.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attractive Qualities.</span>&mdash;Their pretty actions please, and their song is
sweet. They relieve it occasionally by a lively strain, &#8220;<i>diar, diar, hitzi,
ailtz, ailtz!</i>&#8221; which is their call in the pairing season.</p>

<p>I was never able to keep one in the house beyond two or three years.</p></div>

<h4>THE CRESTED TIT.</h4>

<p>Parus cristatus, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; La M&eacute;sange hupp&eacute;e, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Die Haubenmeise,
<span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> bird is four inches and a half in length, of which the
tail measures one and one third. The beak is four lines, and
black; the shanks are seven lines high, and lead blue; the head
is adorned with a crest, composed of feathers nearly an inch
long, black tipped with white, which the bird can erect at
pleasure in a conical form.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Habitation.</span>&mdash;When wild these birds frequent all the pine and fir woods
in Thuringia, but are not so numerous as the other species<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">114</a>. They fly
about low bushes, and therefore delight in places where juniper bushes
abound.</p>

<p>In the house they require the same treatment as the blue tit, and even
greater attention; they can rarely be tamed when taken full grown<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">115</a>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Food.</span>&mdash;In a wild state it feeds in the same manner as the cole tit.</p>

<p>In the house it must be first fed on ants&#8217; eggs, flies, and meal-worms.
It will afterwards eat nuts and hemp-seed, like the other tits, but it seems
to require insects occasionally.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Breeding.</span>&mdash;The nest is formed like that of the cole tit, and placed in the
hole of a tree, amongst some stones, or in large forsaken nests. The brood
consists of from six to ten snow-white eggs, spotted with bright red. The
young must be reared on meal-worms cut small and ants&#8217; eggs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mode of Taking.</span>&mdash;This is the same which is adopted for catching the
cole tits. Its call is &#8220;<i>g&aelig;rrky</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attractive Qualities.</span>&mdash;Its song is not striking, but its form and habits
are very pleasing.</p></div>

<h4>THE BEARDED TIT, OR REED BIRD.</h4>

<p class="center">Parus biarmicus, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; La M&eacute;sange barbue, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Die Bartmeise,
<span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> singular species is somewhat in shape like the oxeye.
It is six inches and a half in length, and measures ten and a
quarter across the expanded wings; the tail is two and three
quarters. The beak is four lines long, a little bent at the
point, and is orange during life, but becomes pale yellow after
death; it is surrounded at the base with black hairs. The iris
is yellow; the shanks are one inch high, and black; the head
is pale ash grey; a tuft of black feathers, which are placed
under the eyes and terminate in a point, is no very slight<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
imitation of a moustache. The tail is wedge-shaped, inclining
to orange; the outer feathers are dark at the base and whitish
at the tip; the third is tipped with white.</p>

<p>The female is without the beard, or moustache<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">116</a>; the top
of the head is rust red, spotted with black; the vent is of the
same colour as the belly.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Habitation.</span>&mdash;In a wild state these birds are found where there are
lakes, large ponds, and extensive marshes full of reeds and aquatic plants;
they rarely show themselves in summer, keeping in pairs amongst the
tufted reeds; but they are seen in winter, when food failing them in these
retreats, they fly about in families, perching on the trees and bushes<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">117</a>.</p>

<p>In the house they must be kept in a large cage to allow them plenty of
exercise, unless permitted to range the room, which is still better.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Food.</span>&mdash;When wild this bird feeds principally on aquatic insects and the
seeds of the common reed (<i>Arundo phragmitis</i>).</p>

<p>In the house they are generally first fed on poppy-seed, ants&#8217; eggs, and
meal-worms, and afterwards on bruised hemp-seed and the food common
for the other tits. It is best to rear them from the nest, as it is very difficult
to preserve those taken when full grown.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Breeding.</span>&mdash;The knowledge on this head is very limited: the nest, placed
in the interwoven stems of the reeds, is in the shape of a purse, and composed
of dried grass and the down of several plants. In this the female
lays four or five speckled eggs, with a pale red ground. The young birds
should be taken from the nest when they are ready to fly, and fed on ants'
eggs and meal-worms cut small.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mode of Taking.</span>&mdash;There is much difficulty in this. Fishermen who
know the places frequented by this species place limed twigs on the reeds,
and try gently to drive them towards one side, and sometimes catch a few<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">118</a>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attractive Qualities.</span>&mdash;In this bird are united beautiful plumage, a
graceful shape, and sprightliness. Its song resembles that of the blue tit,
but its call is very different. It is a pity it is so difficult to obtain. Buffon
says that all of this species that are found in England sprang from a pair
the Countess of Albemarle suffered to escape; but most likely they had not
been seen before from want of attention.</p></div>

<h3>DOVES.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Characteristics.</span>&mdash;The beak is slender, straight, rather
bent at the point, swelled, and covered with a fleshy membrane
at the base; the shanks are short; the toes are divided to their
origin. Doves feed uniformly on grain, though some wild species
also eat myrtle berries.</p>

<p>These birds are faithful to their mates, and produce only two
young ones at each brood, which they feed on grain already
softened in their own crops<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">119</a>. They are generally ranged
amongst the passerine birds, or among poultry, but I think it
best to make them a distinct order, since they have many distinguishing
characteristics. The species I shall mention are
indigenous, and easily tamed at any age.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;"><img src="images/i_315.png" alt="THE RING DOVE, OR CUSHAT." title="" height="223" width="250" /></div>

<h4>THE RING DOVE, OR CUSHAT.</h4>

<p class="center">Columba Palumbus, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; Le Pigeon Ramier, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Die Ringeltaube,
<span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> is the largest of the European wild pigeons, being in
length seventeen inches and a half. Some naturalists suppose
this to be the parent stock of our large domestic pigeons; but
it cannot be domesticated so easily as the stock dove, and never
mixes with the common pigeons in the fields. It does not,
moreover, retire into hollows, like these, but lives and builds
in open and exposed places. The beak is reddish white; the
iris is pale yellow; the shanks are reddish; the head and throat
are dark ash grey; the front of the neck and the breast are
purplish ash grey; the sides and back of the neck are fine
iridescent purple; an almost crescent-shaped white streak
adorns the sides of the neck towards the base, without quite
surrounding it; the belly, the vent, and the thighs, are very
pale grey; the sides are light ash grey; the upper part of the
back, the scapulars, and the lesser wing-coverts, are light
brownish ash grey; the coverts of the primary quill-feathers
are black; the remaining greater coverts are pale ash grey; the
tail is dark ash grey, deepening into black at the extremity.</p>

<p>In the female the streaks on the sides of the neck are not so
wide as in the male; her breast is paler, and all the wing-coverts
are an obscure grey.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Habitation.</span>&mdash;This species, found in Europe and Asia within the temperate
zone, is very common in the woods of Germany and Britain: it
quits us the beginning of October, in small flights, and does not return
till the middle of March, and sometimes later, always some weeks after the
stock dove. During harvest it frequents small groves and detached thickets,
to be nearer the corn fields.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Food.</span>&mdash;It feeds on all kinds of corn and leguminous seeds, myrtle
berries, with the seeds of pines and firs. When a ring dove is caught it
must be first fed on wheat, and other species of corn should by degrees be
mixed with it, but not oats. It will only live a few years in the house.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Breeding.</span>&mdash;This species builds in trees, and forms its nest of dried
branches, but so carelessly that a rather high wind will often blow it down.
The female has two broods in the year, and lays two large white eggs each
time. It succeeds very well to place these eggs under a domestic pigeon,
and if care is taken to prevent the young birds from migrating in autumn
they will afterwards remain in the pigeon house, going out and returning
like the other pigeons that inhabit it; but I have never observed that
they pair with them; I have sometimes seen the ring dove tread the
domestic pigeon, but as yet nothing has resulted from it; future experiments
may perhaps decide this point.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mode of Taking.</span>&mdash;This is the same as with the stock dove. Ring
doves taken when old rarely eat, and die of hunger if they are not
crammed, like young pigeons.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attractive Qualities.</span>&mdash;Besides being a fine bird, the male coos in a
very pleasing and sonorous manner, moving all the time around his mate,
now before, then behind, hopping close to her side, and turning his head in
every direction. It may be rendered very tame.</p></div>

<h4>THE TURTLE DOVE.</h4>

<p class="center">Columba Turtur, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; La Tourterelle, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Die Turteltaube, <span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> pretty species is ten or eleven inches in length. The
beak is slender, and pale blue; the iris is reddish yellow; the
naked circle round the eyes is blush red; the legs and feet are
reddish purple; the forehead is whitish; the top of the head
and upper part of the neck are pale blue; from this to the tail
the blue is more dingy; on each side of the neck is a black spot
striped with three of four crescent-shaped white lines, which
has a pretty effect.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Habitation.</span>&mdash;In their wild state these birds are found throughout the
temperate parts of Europe and Asia, and also in many of the South Sea
Islands. They always prefer woods, but never go far into those on great
chains of mountains; they also frequent detached thickets, and even
orchards when near forests. Being more delicate than the two preceding
species, they do not arrive in our woods till the end of April or beginning
of May, and quit us in September. They are often seen in great numbers
in the forests of Thuringia when the pine seed has ripened well. In 1788
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>a prodigious number were seen; they have never since been so numerous
there<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">120</a>.</p>

<p>In the house we keep them within a grated partition near the stove, where
they can range freely. Young ones reared by a domestic pigeon are easily
accustomed to the dovecot, but as they are very sensible to cold it is necessary
to warm the place they are in during winter. These birds multiply
fast, either paired amongst themselves or with the collared turtle dove.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Food.</span>&mdash;The seeds of the pine seem to be their favourite food here, but
they do not confine themselves to it; they eat peas, vetches, millet, hemp-seed,
rye, and wheat. In the house they may be fed on bread and any
grain at hand: they are easily preserved.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Breeding.</span>&mdash;When wild, their nest, negligently formed of dried sticks, is
tolerably secure when placed in a pine, but is often blown down when in a
beech. The female lays two white eggs.</p>

<p>In the house the turtle dove is given a small straw basket, in which it
builds, for, whether reared from the nest, or taken when full grown, it pairs
without difficulty, and produces young ones. It will also pair with the
collared turtle.</p>

<p>The cooing of the male is peculiar; he utters a deep prolonged sound,
then bends his head and stops. The young birds are grey on the upper part
of the body, and spotted with bluish black on the wings. Those sprung
from a collared and a common turtle dove are more or less like either;
generally they are reddish grey on the head, neck, and breast, the back and
wing-coverts, with red appearing through the grey; the belly, the secondary
quill-feathers, and the end of the tail, are white, and the primaries greyish
brown. These birds are fruitful, and produce others; what is curious is
that they are larger than the parent birds, and have a peculiar note. This
is certainly also the case with other mule birds, as I have often observed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mode of Taking.</span>&mdash;This is the same as with the two preceding species;
snares placed where salt is strewed for deer are sufficient.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attractive Qualities.</span>&mdash;The inhabitants of our forest villages are very
fond of having this turtle dove in their stove apartments, less on account of
its agreeable qualities than from the persuasion that it cures their colds and
rheumatisms. It is certainly true that this bird is generally ill during the
illness of its masters<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">121</a>. It will, however, live six or eight years in the
house.</p></div>

<h4>THE COLLARED TURTLE.</h4>

<p class="center">Columba risoria, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; La Tourterelle &agrave; collier, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Die Lachtaube,
<span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> bird is twelve inches in length; the beak is reddish
white at the base, and dusky on the remaining part; the iris
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
is golden yellow; the shanks are red; the upper part of the
body is reddish white, the under part is pure white; the back
of the neck is adorned with a black crescent, the points of
which turn forward, and the lower part is edged with white;
the shafts of the quill and tail feathers are dusky.</p>

<p>The female is whiter than the male.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Habitation.</span>&mdash;This species is a native of India and China, from which
it has been brought to Europe. It is very common among our peasants,
who fancy it has the power of curing their colds and rheumatisms<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">122</a>. They
assign these poor birds some grated place near the stove, sometimes under
a bench; if they are allowed to range, their wings must be clipped, to
prevent their flying against the windows, and breaking them. They will
generally run under the stove, as they are fond of warmth. They may be
accustomed to the dovecot, but their showy plumage often occasions them
to fall a prey to carnivorous birds. It is also necessary either to warm the
dovecot, or remove them to a heated room during the winter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Food.</span>&mdash;They prefer wheat, and this should be their common food; they
will also eat millet, linseed, poppy, and rape-seed, and even bread. The
peasants give them the siftings of their corn.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Breeding.</span>&mdash;A piece of fur, or soft stuff, or still better, a little basket,
serves as the foundation for their nests. To this they merely add a little
straw, on which they lay two white eggs. They sit on these a fortnight,
but rarely hatch more than one, either from the egg being unfruitful, or
from the carelessness of the parent birds. It is therefore rare to see them
rear six young ones in the year. These resemble the old ones, and the
sex is known by the absence or presence of the reddish colour.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diseases.</span>&mdash;Besides decline, they are subject to all the diseases that
attack the persons shut up in the same room; small-pox, when the children
have it; swollen legs, when any one is attacked with this complaint; and
tumours in the feet, when these are prevalent. Thus we see they partake
of the diseases of their masters, but without curing them, which is contrary
to the ridiculous persuasion of the ignorant peasant. Yet with all these
evils they will live seven years.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attractive Qualities.</span>&mdash;These birds are very neat and gentle. Their
cooing resembles laughter; but, besides this, the male has other tones still
more tender, to invite his mate to come to the nest, and he passes the
night close to her side. When he coos he does not turn like the domestic
pigeon, but hops forward a little, then stops, bends his head to the ground,
and swells his crop.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Characteristics.</span>&mdash;These birds are characterised by the
beak being raised, and the upper mandible being arched, so
that the edges of it go beyond those of the under mandible.
The nostrils are covered with a convex cartilaginous membrane;
the tail is composed of more than twelve feathers;
the toes are connected as far as the first joint. Most of the
species feed on grain, which is softened in their crops. I only
know of six species that can be tamed in the house.</p>

<h4>THE COMMON PARTRIDGE.</h4>

<p class="center">Tetrao Perdrix, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; La Perdrix grise, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Das gemeine Rebhuhn,
<span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> well known bird, which is very fleshy, and has but
few feathers, measures twelve inches and a half. Its beak is
bluish, the feet brownish blush red; under each eye is a
naked skin of a bright scarlet colour; the general colour of
the plumage is brown and ash grey, mixed with black; the
forehead, a streak above the eyes, and the throat, are fine
chestnut brown; the fore part of the neck and the breast are
ash grey, with very fine black lines; below the breast is a
deep chestnut brown streak in the shape of a horse shoe, which
is not found in the female, or at least not so large nor so
clearly defined; the quill-feathers are dusky, with cross bands
of rust red; the tail-feathers are rust brown.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Habitation.</span>&mdash;The common partridge is found throughout Europe, in
fields and adjoining woods: when in the open country, thickets and bushes
serve as a retreat during the night. In wide plains, where the frosts are
severe, and the snow so deep that the game is in danger of perishing, it is
customary, in winter, to catch in a net as many as possible of these birds,
and keep them in a warmed room with a high ceiling. If such a room
cannot be had, the top of the room and windows should be hung with cloth,
to prevent the frightened birds from injuring themselves.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Food.</span>&mdash;In the house, when permitted to range, partridges may be fed on
barley and wheat. They will also eat bread, the common universal paste,
cabbage, beet, and lettuce; for they like green vegetables, and these are
almost indispensable to their health. In a state of liberty, they generally
feed in winter on the tops of grass and young springing seeds. In the
summer, they eat clover and other green plants, as well as all kinds of
grain. They often roll in moist sand, which they should be allowed to do
in the house.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Breeding.</span>&mdash;The best way to domesticate the partridge, is to rear it
young, in which case it becomes extremely tame, and its habits are very
pleasing. These young birds must be fed at first on ants&#8217; eggs and hens'
eggs boiled hard and chopped up with salad; afterwards they will eat
barley and other dry food. The covey often consists of twenty young ones,
which follow the mother as soon as they are hatched, and often fall in the
way of mowers, shepherds, and huntsmen. I am persuaded that it would
not be difficult to render these birds quite domestic, if the eggs were
hatched by our barn-door fowls, in an open, yet enclosed place, clipping the
wings of the young ones, allowing them to range, during the summer, in a
garden surrounded with walls, and giving them plenty of food. Supposing
that this plan did not quite succeed the first summer, one would have at
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>least half-tamed birds, which, by following the same plan, would gradually
become more and more accustomed to domestic food, the society of man,
and would certainly at last breed in the house, like our common fowls.</p></div>

<h4>THE COMMON QUAIL.</h4>

<p class="center">Tetrao coturnix, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; La Caille, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Die Wachtel, <span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> species is the most common of wild poultry kept in
the house. It is rather more than seven inches in length.
The beak is short and horn-coloured, dusky in summer, and
ash grey in winter, like the partridge&#8217;s and common fowl&#8217;l;
the iris is olive brown; the feet pale bluish red; on the upper
part of the body are dusky and rust-red spots, with some
small white streaks; the throat is dusky, surrounded with
two chestnut brown bands; the front of the neck and the
breast are pale rust red, with some longitudinal dark streaks;
the belly is dusky white; the thighs are reddish grey; the
quill-feathers are dark grey, crossed by many rust red lines; the
tail is short, dark brown, with pale rust red streaks across it.</p>

<p>The female differs sensibly; her throat is white, and her
breast, paler than that of the male, is spotted with black like
the thrush&#8217;h.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Habitation.</span>&mdash;When wild the quail is found throughout the old world.
Unlike the other species of poultry, it is a bird of passage, arriving in Europe
in May, and departing the end of September. It keeps continually in
corn fields, preferring those of wheat.</p>

<p>In the house, if allowed to range, its gentleness, neatness, and peculiar
motions, are seen to advantage; but it is often kept in a cage of the following
make:&mdash;A small box two feet long, one foot deep, and four high, of any
shape which is preferred; in this are left two or three openings, one for
drinking at, the other to give light; besides this all is dark; the bottom
is a drawer, which should be covered with sand, and have a seed drawer at
one end; the top is of green cloth, for as the quail often springs up it
would hurt itself were it of wood. This case should be suspended during
the summer outside the window, for the quail sings much more when confined
in this manner than if allowed to range the room, where there are
many things to call off its attention from its song<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">123</a>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span></p>

<p>When a male without the female is allowed to run about the room, it
is always necessary to shut it up in June (the pairing season), or else its
ardent feelings tempt it to attack all the other birds, particularly those with
a dark plumage, somewhat resembling its own. Larks, for example, it
will follow, and pluck out their feathers till they are nearly bare.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Food.</span>&mdash;In a wild state the quail feeds on wheat and other corn, rape-seed,
millet, hemp-seed, and the like. It also eats green vegetables, as
well as insects, and particularly ants&#8217; eggs.</p>

<p>In the house it is fed on the same food, adding bread, barley meal mixed
with milk, the universal paste, and occasionally salad or cabbage chopped
up small, and, that it may want nothing to keep it in health, plenty of
river sand for it to roll in and to peck up grains, which assist its digestion;
but this sand must be damp, for if dry it will not touch it. It drinks a
great deal, and the water, contrary to the opinion of some persons, should
be clear, never turbid. It moults twice in the year, once in autumn, and
again in spring; it then requires river sand, and greater attention than at
other times.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Breeding.</span>&mdash;The quail breeds very late, never before July. Its nest, if
it can be called so, is a hole scratched in the earth, in which it lays from
ten to fourteen bluish-white eggs, with large brown spots. These are
hatched after three weeks&#8217; incubation. The young ones, all hairy, follow
the mother the moment they leave the shell. Their feathers grow quickly,
for in the autumn they are able to depart with her to the southern countries.
The males are so ardent, that if one is placed in a room with a
female, he will pursue her immediately with extraordinary eagerness,
tearing off her feathers if she resists in the least; he is less violent if he
has been in the same room with her during the year. The female, in this
case, lays a great many eggs, but rarely sits on them; yet if young ones
are brought her from the fields, she eagerly receives them under her wings,
and becomes a very affectionate mother to them. The young must be fed
on eggs boiled hard and cut small, but the best way is to take the mother
with the covey, which may be done with a net. She watches over them
attentively, and they are more easily reared. During the first year one
would think that all in the covey were females, the males resemble them
so much, particularly before the brown shows itself on the throat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mode of Taking.</span>&mdash;There are several different methods of taking quails,
but I shall only mention the commonest and easiest. The male birds are
generally caught in a net, called a quail-net, by means of a call which
imitates the cry of the female in the breeding season; it is the way adopted
by bird-catchers in the spring, when they wish to take a male that sings
in a superior manner, that is, which repeats a dozen times following the
syllables &#8220;<i>pieveroie</i>.&#8221; If the male has not yet met with a mate, and if
he has not been rendered suspicious by some unskilful bird-catcher, he
will run eagerly into the snare. The most important thing is to have a
good call; they may be had cheap of turners at Nuremberg, who make
them of leather, with a pipe turned from the bone of a cat or hare, or the
leg of a stork; but they may easily be made by any body. The first
thing necessary is a piece of calf-skin, one foot in length, and four inches
in breadth, the sides must be sewed together within two inches of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>end, and the bottom filled with a piece of wood an inch and a half in
length, and rings composed of thick leather, the diameter of the interior
opening not exceeding an inch and a half, are pushed into the sewed
cylinder, and kept about a quarter of an inch apart; the whole may afterwards
be pressed close together, making the rings touch each other; then
a tube made of the bone of a goose or hare, and filled at the end like a
common whistle, is fastened to the part of the cylinder left unsewed; the
interior is then stopped with wax near the notch on the side of the leather,
and a hole pierced through it with a knitting-needle; the upper part of
the tube must also be stopped with wax, and lastly, the lower part, which
is thus become a kind of whistle, is very firmly tied to the unsewn part of
the cylinder. When the call is to be used, the lower end must be held
firmly in one hand, and the leather cylinder worked up and down with the
other, making the rings approach and separate, which produces the notes of
the female, &#8220;<i>peuk, peuk, pupu</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>As soon as the male quail is heard that you wish to procure, you must
advance softly to within fifty paces of his station, and place the tray
amongst the wheat in such a position as will suffer it to fall level with the
ground, to prevent the bird&#8217;s passing under and escaping. Then retire a
few steps back, when the quail will soon utter its song, to which reply
with two or three notes, that when the quail is silent he may only hear
one or two, from the call exactly resembling the cry of the female. If
this is not done with care, the bird will suspect treachery, and will either
retire or remain silent, and never after fall into such a snare; but if
skilfully done, it is surprising to see how the bird proceeds directly to the
call: if by chance he miss the trap, he will go so near as to be within
reach of the hand; in this case it is best to retire softly to the other side
of the trap and repeat the call, which will again attract it. There are
some quails that know how to avoid the net, particularly if placed in too
open and exposed a place. In this case it is safest to turn it in a corner
at both ends, and thus when it tries to turn it becomes entangled.</p>

<p>It is proper to notice, that in damp weather, or when it rains, the
quail does not run, but flies immediately towards the call. It does this
also in dewy mornings and evenings; dry days should therefore be chosen
for this chase. In the pairing season, two, three, or even four quails may
be taken at the same place.</p>

<p>If no male is heard in the field, the call of the female must be well
imitated on a larger and more powerful bird-call, and, if any males are
within hearing, they will not fail to answer; the person must then
advance quickly, placing the net so as to stop their road, and repeat
the call.</p>

<p>When a female is to be caught, it is best to employ a common net,
such as is used to take quails in autumn; but this chase should be
deferred till towards the end of harvest, when most of the corn is cut, and
only a few pieces left standing, which serve to harbour numbers of these
birds. Several nets are used at once, as many as six or eight; some of
them are placed across the field of corn, and the others parallel to them
at the extremity of the same field: this being done, the party go to the
opposite side and begin to drive the quails into the nets in the middle of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>the field by means of a packthread stretched across the corn, having little
bells suspended to it by threads, so as almost to touch the ground, two
persons holding it, and as they advance shaking it from time to time.
As soon as the prisoners are secured, the march is continued towards the
nets at the end of the field; and in this manner great numbers of
quails, both male and female, are procured either for the house or for
the table.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attractive Qualities.</span>&mdash;Besides beauty of form and plumage, the
song of this bird is no slight recommendation to the amateur. In the
breeding season, that of the male commences by repeating softly, tones
resembling &#8220;<i>verra, verra</i>,&#8221; followed by the word &#8220;<i>pieveroie</i>,&#8221; uttered
in a bold tone, with the neck raised, the eyes shut, and the head inclined
on one side. Those that repeat the last syllables ten or twelve times
consecutively, are the most esteemed. That of the female only consists
of &#8220;<i>verra, verra</i>,&#8221; &#8220;<i>pupu, pupu</i>,&#8221; the two last syllables being those
by which the male and the female attract each other&#8217;s attention; when
alarmed or angry their cry resembles &#8220;<i>guillah!</i>&#8221; but at other times it is
only a murmur, resembling the purring of a cat.</p>

<p>The quail never sings when left to run about in a light room, except
during the night, but continually when in a darkened cage. Those reared
from the nest begin to sing the end of December, and continue till September;
whilst those taken full grown rarely commence till the beginning
of May, and cease in August.</p></div>

<h3>WADING BIRDS.</h3>

<p>The birds of this order are more or less bare above the
knees; their legs are so long, that they have the appearance of
standing on stilts. They may be tamed at any age, but this
is best done when they are young. I shall only give here the
following species.</p>

<hr />

<h4>THE WHITE STORK.</h4>

<p class="center">Ciconia alba, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; La Cicogne blanche, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Der Weisse Storch,
<span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> stork may be considered as half domestic, since it constantly
builds on the tops of houses, on churches or towers in
the midst of villages, and even towns<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">124</a>. Its beak is long and</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span></p>
<p>powerful, of a blood red colour, as are its legs and feet. It
has a naked black ring round its eyes; the wings are black;
the rest of the plumage white.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Observations.</span>&mdash;It is a bird of passage, which quits Europe the end of
September, and returns in April. It feeds on fish, amphibious animals,
field-mice, moles, and even weasels, which it catches coming out of their
holes. It also eats insects, especially bees, which it catches by the beakfull
on flowers. Its nest is only a heap of dry sticks woven together, and
it occupies the same nest every year, after repairing it a little. I have
been assured, that some nests have lasted a hundred years; and the circumference
often becomes covered with sparrows and swallows&#8217; nests. The
male and female never separate, and are a true model of conjugal fidelity.
If the young ones are taken from the nest, and fed on frogs and meat, they
may be rendered so tame that they will go a league from the house, and
return again regularly. At the time of their flight, in September, the
wings of those that are to be kept through the winter should be clipped,
and they should be kept in a temperate place, as their feet are very sensible
to cold. They become so familiar that they will enter the room during
meals, to be fed on meat from the table. A clapping with their beak
expresses either anger or affection. It is very pleasing to see a tame stork
circling round the house, and descending insensibly in a long spiral line
till it reaches the ground.</p></div>

<hr />

<h4>THE BLACK STORK.</h4>

<p class="center">Ardea nigra, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; Der schwarze Storch, <span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> species is nearly as large as the white stork, and is of
the same form, but its limbs are weaker and more delicate.
Its colour is a glossy brownish black, with the breast and
belly white. It frequents woods in the neighbourhood of
marshes, lakes, and large ponds, and makes its nest on the trees.
Its habits and manner of feeding are similar to those of the
white stork. In rearing the young ones, they may be accustomed
to remain in the house, and will soon become
familiar.</p>

<hr />

<h4>THE WOODCOCK.</h4>

<p class="center">Scolopax rusticola, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; La B&eacute;casse, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Die Waldschnepfe,
<span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> woodcock is found in every part of Europe where
there are forests. The beak is three or four inches in length,
straight, and reddish at the base; the back of the head is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
crossed with dusky bands; the upper part of the body and
wings are rust brown, streaked with grey and black; the
breast and belly are dusky white, with dark brown lines.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Observations.</span>&mdash;The woodcock builds its nest on the ground in mountainous
districts; lays three or four dusky pale yellow eggs, and feeds on
worms, snails, and the grubs of insects, which it seeks in meadows, marshes,
and fields. In October it quits the high lands for more temperate parts;
this migration is called its <i>passage</i>, and as these birds constantly follow
the same route, this is the time when fowlers, scattered in its destined path,
prepare for a chase, either with guns or large nets made for the purpose,
and await the moment when these birds quit the meadows for the woods,
or the woods for the meadows. The flight of woodcocks is slow and
awkward, but they are very fine game, the flesh being wholesome and of an
excellent flavour; they are generally cooked without taking out the
intestines.</p>

<p>In the house, by beginning with insects and ants&#8217; eggs, the woodcock
may be accustomed by degrees to the universal paste. Twenty years ago
I saw, in an aviary at Carlsruhe, a tame woodcock that would come from
his cage and show himself to strangers; it was a male, and appeared very
willing to pair, if it could have found a mate.</p></div>

<hr />

<h4>THE COMMON SNIPE.</h4>

<p class="center">Scolopax Gallinago, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; La B&eacute;cassine, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Die Heerschnepfe,
<span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> Snipe is nearly the size of the quail, and inhabits the
northern countries of Europe, Asia, and America, migrating in
autumn to more temperate parts. Its rough beak is black in
the front; its feet are brown; the head is divided longitudinally
by two reddish brown lines; the back is dark brown, with
streaks across; the throat is white; the neck is brown, speckled
with brick red; the belly is white; the vent is striped with
black; the quill-feathers are dark brown, tipped with white;
the tail-feathers are black from the base, tipped with orange,
and having two dark brown streaks.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Observations.</span>&mdash;The snipe darts through the air at a great height, and
descends like an arrow, continually uttering the cry &#8220;<i>maicherai</i>.&#8221; It is
found in marshy places, abounding with bushes and brambles; in a hole in
the ground, washed by the water, it lays four or five dusky olive-coloured
eggs, streaked with brown. Its common food is worms, and the grubs of
insects, but it will eat corn, and the tender roots of marsh plants. Every
one knows that it is delicate eating; but many are ignorant that it may be
tamed, and that it is then a very pleasing bird.</p></div>

<p class="caption">THE LAPWING.</p></div>

<h4>THE LAPWING.</h4>

<p class="center">Tringa Vanellus, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; Le Vanneu, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Der gemeine Kiebetz,
<span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> bird is well known throughout Europe wherever there
are water meadows. It is greenish on the back and wings;
black on the breast; and has red feet, and a handsome crest.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Observations.</span>&mdash;It feeds on all sorts of insects, small snails, worms, and
even plants. The young ones are easily tamed. They are first fed on
ants&#8217; eggs, and then gradually accustomed to bread, and even bran mixed
with milk. The eggs may be placed under pigeons, but care is necessary
when they are hatched, as they run the moment they leave the shell. The
old birds may be kept in the garden if the wings are clipped, where they
destroy the insects and worms; but they must be brought into the house
in the winter, and fed at first on bullocks&#8217; heart cut in the form of worms,
then with less care, till by degrees they become accustomed to other meat,
and even to bread. As these birds are much esteemed game, snares are
laid for them in places they frequent in large flocks. They are either
taken in nets, throwing worms as baits, or with nooses made of horse hair,
and set in the paths they trace in the rushes, or, which is cruel and
destructive, in the neighbourhood of their nests.</p></div>

<hr />

<h4>THE RUFF.</h4>

<p class="center">Tringa pugnax, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; Le Combattant, ou Paon de Mer, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Die
Kampfhahn, <span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> ruff is about the size of the lapwing, and is found in
the north of Europe, near lakes, ponds, and extensive marshes.
It is almost the only wild bird whose plumage varies like our
domesticated ones, ash-grey, brown, black, and white, being
combined in a thousand different ways, so that it is rare to meet
with two birds alike. The following are the characteristics of
the species:&mdash;1st, a kind of ruff or collar, formed of long
feathers hanging around the neck, which are raised when the
bird is angry, and stand out on all sides; 2nd, the face red, and
covered with pimples; the beak and feet also red.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span></p>

<p>The colours of the females are more uniform:&mdash;pale brown,
the back streaked with black, the breast and belly white, and
the neck plain without the ruff.</p>

<p>It feeds on insects, worms, and roots, and makes its nest in a
tuft of grass or rushes. The females are tolerably good for the
table, but the male must be fattened before it is eatable. The
irritable and quarrelsome disposition of these birds is astonishing.
When two males meet they are often so enraged with
each other that a net may be passed over them without their
perceiving it. If several are placed in the same cage, they will
kill one another. The young ones may easily be reared; but
it is extraordinary, that in the house, their inclination to fight
abandons them; whilst most other birds, pacific in a state of
freedom, are continually quarrelling and pecking one another
when confined. It is customary in the duchy of Bremen to
put these birds into enclosed gardens to destroy worms and
other insects, but they retire into the house for the winter;
and here the old ones still quarrel both for food and the place
they wish to lie down in. They are fed on bread soaked in
milk, and meat.</p>

<hr />

<h4>THE PURR.</h4>

<p class="center">Tringa Cinclus, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; L&#8217;Llouette de Mer, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Der Meerlerche,
<span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> is a marsh bird, about the size of the redwing, and is
very common on the banks of rivers, lakes, and large ponds.
When it rises in the air it cries continually &#8220;<i>tzi, tzi, tzi, tzi</i>.&#8221;
Its beak is black, and its feet dark brownish green; the feathers
on the upper part of the body are grey, glossy, and silky, with
blackish bands notched on the sides, and bordered on the outer
edge with rust red; a whitish streak passes above the eyes,
whilst a narrow dark brown line crosses them; the under part
of the body is pure white, but the breast is striped with dark
brown; the quill-feathers are black, the anterior having a broad
white streak on the inner web, the others having the same on
the outer web; the greater coverts are tipped with white,
which form two spots on the wings; the three middle feathers
of the tail are grey brown with black bands; the others are
white, with dark brown bands.</p>

<p>The female is rather larger, and her plumage is paler.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Observations.</span>&mdash;It is easy to obtain this bird, which has many attractions
for the amateur. It runs quickly, continually shaking the back part of its
body, and repeating, particularly towards evening, its loud and tender call,
&#8220;<i>hidutzt</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>When wild it eats insects and worms, found near the water. In the
house it will soon eat the universal paste, if a few meal-worms and ants'
eggs are at first thrown amongst it. If there are other birds in the same
room, the water vessel should be removed from the food, or another vessel
devoted to it, for not being able to swallow what is not soft, it carries all its
food to the water to soak, and thus renders it dirty. It catches insects very
dexterously; it advances slowly like a cat, its head bent down, and then
darts forward swiftly and slyly. I admire their habits so much that I have
one generally in my house. I have observed that all the species of snipes
have the habit of turning over any stones they meet with, to look for
insects under. It is very easy to take the purr as soon as the stakes, sticks,
and other places where they most commonly alight, are known; it is only
to put bird-lime on them and drive the birds gently towards the part.
This and the corn crake are the only two marsh birds that should properly
be reckoned among house-birds.</p></div>

<h4>THE MOOR HEN.</h4>

<p class="center">Fulica enloropus, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; La Poule d&#8217;dau, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Die gr&uuml;nf&uuml;ssiges
Meehuhn, <span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> length of this species is ten or twelve inches. The
beak is greenish at the tip, red towards the base; the naked
spaces above the knees are of the same colour; the feet are
olive green; the claws are very long; the head, the upper part
of the neck, the body, and the wing-coverts are dark olive
green; the anterior quill-feathers and the tail are dark brown;
the breast and belly are ash-grey; the vent and edges of the
wings are white.</p>

<p>In the female the beak is olive brown towards the base,
instead of red.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Observations.</span>&mdash;Though not web-footed, this species swims as well as
those birds that are, and has this advantage over them, that it can rest on
trees and bushes by the water side, like land birds, and can also run when
inclined. Its nest is placed among bushes that are in the water, or on
reeds, and is built of water plants, especially reeds well interwoven; it is
so firmly fastened, that if the water rises it floats, but is not carried away;
the eggs are often surrounded with water. It feeds on insects, seeds,
and aquatic plants. It is easily tamed, particularly when taken young; it
likes white bread soaked in milk. I often have these birds in my poultry-yard
among my fowls; they go to a neighbouring pond, and regularly return
after a short time. I never took any trouble to tame them; they always
kept near the water, by the dunghill, seeking after insects and grubs.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> corn crake being always found with quails in proportionate
numbers, departing with them in autumn, and returning
at the same time in spring, no doubt deserves the name Buffon
has given it of King of the Quails. It is ten inches in length.
The beak is flattish, greyish brown above, and bluish red
beneath; the feet are lead grey; the feathers of the head, of
the back of the neck, of the back, and even of the tail, are
black, edged with reddish grey; which gives them the appearance
of being streaked; a grey ash-coloured streak passes above
the eyes, another below them; the wing-coverts and anterior
quill-feathers are chestnut brown; the front of the neck and
the breast are dusky ash-grey; the belly is white, but the
sides and vent are dark brown, spotted with rusty brown and
white.</p>

<p>The breast of the female is pale grey, and the streaks near
her eyes greyish white.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Observations.</span>&mdash;The male is often heard uttering his kind of croaking
notes, &#8220;<i>arrp, schnarrp</i>,&#8221; in the meadows and fields, in the evening and
at night; but is rarely seen to fly. It feeds on insects and grain, for which
bread soaked in milk may be substituted, when it is in the house. The
female lays from eight to twelve greenish grey eggs, streaked with pale
brown, on the bare ground; the young ones, when hatched, are covered
with a kind of black down, the feathers of varied colours do not appear
for three weeks. The hen sits with so much constancy, that she will often
perish by the sithe rather than quit her eggs. The young, like the young
quails, run under the oat sheaves, and may easily be caught there by
the hand.</p>

<p>The agility of these birds, and their pleasing habits, render them much
admired in the house; they chirp very much like chickens. I confess I
like very much to hear the &#8220;<i>arrp, schnarrp</i>&#8221; of the male in the evening
near me.</p></div>

<h3>WEB-FOOTED BIRDS.</h3>

<p>The birds arranged in this order are also known, under the
name of aquatic birds. They are distinguished by their feet,
the toes being united by a broad membrane, which assists them
in swimming. Several live uniformly on the water, others in
companies on the water and on the land. There are many
that may be tamed, but I shall only speak of those that are
able to live without being on the water. The number is thus
confined to six species, easily tamed at any age.</p>

<p class="center">Anas Olor, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; Le gigne, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Der Schwan, <span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Instead</span> of the common name of tame swan, I prefer that of
mute swan, in order to distinguish this from the whistling,
also called the wild swan, but improperly, for in Russia it is
more common to have that tamed than the one under notice.
This, however, is found wild throughout most parts of Europe,
and in great numbers in Siberia. In Germany, when a
person wishes to have one on a piece of water, and to keep it
there constantly, he chooses some young ones, and breaks or
cuts the first bone in the wing, to disable them from flying,
and consequently prevent their departing in the autumn with
their wild companions.</p>

<p>The swan is larger than a domestic goose, it is four feet and
a half in length, on account of its long neck, which it bends in
the form of an S when it is swimming; it measures seven feet
and a quarter from tip to tip of the wings, and weighs from
twenty-five to thirty pounds. The beak is dark red, having
at the base a large black callous knob, and at the tip something
resembling the head of a nail, black, and rather bent; a bare
black triangular streak extends from the beak to the eyes; the
feet are black the first year, lead grey the second, and reddish
lead grey at last; the plumage is a snowy white.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Observations.</span>&mdash;The story of its melodious death-song is now quite exploded;
the organisation of its windpipe permits only a slight hiss, a dull
murmur, and a gentle croaking. Song, properly so called, belongs exclusively
to the whistling swan; a poet may have heard it once, and without
observing the difference between the birds, have attributed it to the common
swan. The latter feeds on insects and aquatic plants; during the
winter corn should be given it, and it must be kept in a temperate place.
The female forms a large nest, of the stalks of rushes, reeds, and other
plants, and lines it with feathers from her breast. She lays six or eight
greenish white eggs, and sits on them five weeks. During this time, the
male is always near her, driving away and pursuing all that would approach.
He has such strength of wing, that a well-aimed blow of it would break a
man&#8217;s leg. The young ones are at first grey. It is said that swans will
live a hundred years. Their utility as well as their beauty would merit
more attention than is commonly paid to their education, which is easier
than that of geese. Lithuania, Poland, and eastern Prussia, send several
quintals every year to the fair of Frankfort upon Oder. Many tame swans
are also collected on the Sprey, round Berlin, Spandau, and Potsdam;
particularly in May, to rob them of their down. The skins with the
down on them are prepared for pelisses; powder puffs are also made of it.</p></div>

<h4>THE SHELDRAKE.</h4>

<p class="center">Anas Tadorna, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; Le Tadorne, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Der Bruntente, <span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> species measures two feet from the tip of the beak to
the extremity of the tail; the beak is smooth, flattish, and of
a scarlet colour; a fleshy knob covers the upper base; the
nostrils and nail at the end of the beak are black; the feet are
bluish red; the head and upper part of the neck are duck
green; the rest of the neck and belly are white; a wide
orange brown band crosses the breast; the back, with the
wing-coverts, is white; the scapulars are speckled with
black; the first quill-feathers are black, the following violet,
the middle ones rusty brown, and the last white; the speculum
is green, reflecting a beautiful violet; the feathers of the tail
are white, tipped with black.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Observations.</span>&mdash;This species, found in the north of Europe and Asia,
hollows out the sand by the sea-shore, or uses a forsaken rabbit&#8217;s hole,
or some cavity in a rock, to form its nest in. The beauty of its plumage
has attracted the attention of amateurs, who tame it, and keep it in the
poultry-yard; but it is not useful, its flesh having an unpleasant smell and
flavour. It feeds with the other ducks, and becomes very familiar; it
ever appears intelligent.</p></div>

<hr />

<h4>THE WILD GOOSE.</h4>

<p class="center">Anas anser ferus, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; L&#8217;Lie sauvage, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Der wilde Gans, <span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> is the parent stock of our domestic goose, and though
smaller, it has a longer neck and larger wings. The upper
part of the body is brownish grey, the under part is greyish
white; the breast is clouded with rusty brown; the beak is
orange and black; the feet are red. Several domestic geese preserve
this original plumage, even to the colours of the beak.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Observations.</span>&mdash;This species frequents the shores of the North Sea
during the summer; but in autumn departs in large flights disposed in a
triangular form, and passes the winter in more southern countries, feeding
on the blades of newly-sprung rye.</p>

<p>There are places in Thuringia where thousands of these birds collect in
winter; they are very distrustful, placing sentinels as soon as they alight,
which are so watchful, that it is very difficult to take or shoot them. If
by chance the wing of one of these geese is shot, it may easily be kept in
the yard with poultry; they are also taken in snares laid in places
frequented by them during the night; they associate without difficulty
with the domestic geese; but I only know one instance of a wild male
pairing with a domesticated female.</p></div>

<h4>THE SCAUP DUCK.</h4>

<p class="center">Anas marila, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; Le Milloninan, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Der Bergente, <span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> species, like the former, passes in autumn from the
north to the south. They are caught and shot among the
common wild ducks. The scaup duck may be tamed so far
as to remain sociably among the domestic ones, will eat bread
soaked in water, oats, and barley; in short, all that is given
to common ducks. Its size also is similar, but it is black,
with the belly and speculum white; five black transverse lines
unite on the white ground of the upper part of the body; the
wings and tail are dusky.</p>

<hr />

<h4>THE MALLARD.</h4>

<p class="center">Anas Boschas fera, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; Le Canoel sauvage, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Der wilde Ente
<span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Our</span> domestic ducks derive their origin from this species.
It is spread throughout Europe on lakes, ponds, and rivers.
Its length is two feet; its plumage ash grey, striped and
waved transversely with white and brown; the head and neck
are bright green, known by the name of duck-green; the
breast is chestnut brown; the speculum violet green. The
female is brown, like a lark.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Observations.</span>&mdash;Like other birds of the same order, the wild ducks
unite in large flights in the autumn, but divide into pairs in summer, and
build their nests either near the water, among the reeds and bushes, in
the trunks of old trees, or sometimes even in the depths of woods. They
lay from twelve to sixteen eggs. In the forest districts of Thuringia,
the young ones are met with in considerable numbers, being led to a
neighbouring pond by the parent birds. If, after having mutilated or
lamed the end of the wing, they are put into a pond with domestic ducks,
they live and pair with them, become accustomed to their mode of life,
follow them in winter into the house, without any decoy but being fed
plentifully. Wild ducks are taken in nets, snares, and even with
fishing-hooks.</p>

<p>By pairing a mallard with a female domestic duck, a very fine middle
race is obtained, which remains domestic<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">125</a>.</p></div>

<h4>THE TARROCK.</h4>

<p class="center">Larus tridactylus, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; Larus rissa, cinereus et n&aelig;vius, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; La
Monette cendr&eacute;e, <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>; Der Wintermeeve, <span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">These</span> birds, about fourteen inches in length, change their
plumage till they are four years old, which occasions great
variety. In the old ones, the beak is yellowish green on the
outside, and orange within; the feet are olive, and are without
the back toe; the head, throat, neck, the rest of the upper
part of the body, and the tail, are white. There is often a
blackish streak behind the ear; the back and wing-coverts
are pale grey or bluish; the quill-feathers are white; the
primaries are tipped with black; those that have a dark grey
crescent on the neck have not attained their fourth year; those
streaked are young ones.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Observations.</span>&mdash;The tarrocks remain in the north of Europe during
summer, and go south in winter. In February, when snow comes after
mild weather, great numbers are seen to stop on the ponds and rivers in
Germany, where many perish; they may then be taken with nets and
snares placed on the banks, after removing the snow. Though their
proper food is fish and aquatic insects, they are contented, in the poultry-yard,
with bread and other food; are easily tamed, and live equally well
on the water or the land; in winter, they should be kept in a moderately
warm situation; they may even be left in the court, driving them in the
evening into the place appropriated to them for the night.</p></div>

of the young ones, who will thus have their attention directed to other birds, which
they will imitate or modify according to the conformation of their larynx; and
they will thus create new variations, which will afterwards be imitated by their
young ones, and become hereditary, until a circumstance of a similar nature may

a degree in longitude, and is rarely found in Britain. Few birds of this group,
as far as has hitherto been observed, wander to the right or left during their
migration. The roller frequents shady and solitary woods, and its character is
well adapted to them.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Translator.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_20_20" id="Footnote_20_20"></a><a href="#FNanchor_20_20"><span class="label">20</span></a> I once saw one of these birds drink, after swallowing dry ants&#8217; eggs; it
then eat greedily of lettuce and endive. Another, which I kept, liked the
outside of lettuces and spinach after having eaten insects, especially beetles,
which are very heating. To judge from what I have observed, the roller is
by nature wild and solitary; it seldom changes its situation, except to seek its
food or to hide itself from strangers. It is a good thing, whether kept in a cage
or let range, always to have a box in its way, in which it may take refuge when
frightened; it will not fail to hide itself there, and by this means will not be
tempted to beat itself violently, which it does when it cannot fly from the object
of its fright. It knows its mistress very well, lets her take it up, comes near her,
and sits without any fear on her knees for whole hours without stirring. This
is as far as it goes even when tamed. It is neither caressing nor familiar; when
frightened it utters harsh cries, softer ones when its food is brought, but &#8220;<i>crag,

was kept in a small cage of plain oak wood and wire. During a night and a day
that his confinement lasted, his tapping labour was incessant; and after occupying
his prison for that short space, he left the wood-work pierced and worn like worm-eaten
timber. His impatience at his situation was excessive; his efforts to escape
were unremitted, and displayed much intelligence and cunning. He was fierce,
fearlessly familiar, and voracious of the food placed before him. At the close of
the second day he sunk under the combined effects of his vexation, assiduity, and
voracity. His hammering was peculiarly laborious, for he did not peck as other
birds do, but grasping hold with his immense feet, he turned upon them as a pivot,
and struck with the whole weight of his body, thus assuming the appearance, with
his entire form, of the head of a hammer, or, as birds may sometimes be seen to
do on mechanical clocks, made to strike the hour by swinging on a wheel. The
Rev. W. T. Bree, of Allesley, says, that having caught a nuthatch in the common
brick trap used by boys, he was struck with the singular appearance of its bill, so
unlike that of any bird he had ever seen. It was blunt at the end, and presented
the appearance of having been truncated in an oblique direction, as if the natural
beak had been cut off. He naturally inferred that it had been fairly ground down
to about two-thirds of its original length, by the bird&#8217;s pecking at the bricks, in its
efforts to escape from the trap.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Translator.</span></p></div>

sometimes yield to the allurements of a very ardent hen canary. I have myself

young. Dr. Jassy, however, writes me from Frankfort, that he has obtained
mules of a bullfinch and canary, by making other canaries sit on the eggs and bring
up the young; and that this plan is pursued in Bohemia. A tufted or crested female

&#8220;The instinct,&#8221; says Buffon, &#8220;which induces hen larks to bring up and watch

precede it.
</p><p>
&#8220;In the month of May, a young lark was brought to me which could not feed
itself; I fed it, and it could hardly peck up, when a brood of four young ones of
the same species was brought to me from another place. She exhibited a singular
affection for these new comers, which were not much younger than herself; she
nursed them day and night, warmed them under her wings, and pushed the food
into their mouths with her beak; nothing could distract her from these interesting
duties. If she was removed from the young ones, she flew back to them as soon as
she was free, without ever thinking of escaping, as she might have done a hundred
times. Her affection increased so much that she literally forgot to eat and drink;
and she lived only on the food which was given to her as well as to her adopted
young, and she died at length, consumed by this sort of maternal passion. None of
the young survived her, they died one after the other, so necessary had her maternal
cares become to them; so entirely were these cares produced by affection,
and reciprocated.&#8221;

accident befalling it during the night, held the cage towards it, into which it instantly
jumped with pleasure. Since then it has been allowed to range three adjoining
rooms. It is always lively, coming when its mistress calls, and perching on her
finger, and seeking in her half-closed hand the flies she may have there. It made a
nest in a window-curtain, into which it would glide secretly in the evening, but would
never go whilst any eyes were turned on that side, and seized a favourable moment

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;To the reverend gentleman who gives us this book we owe much; it is so
admirably done as to be thoroughly perfect as far as the subject goes. He tells us
everything about the canary, and in the pleasantest manner, enlivening his story
with many anecdotes. It is written in a tender and loving spirit; lucky are the
birds who have so sympathetic and considerate a master, and fortunate is the master
who owns so many beautiful birds; for the charming pictures that decorate the
volume are so many portraits of &#8216;<i>the author&#8217;s own pets</i>.' Mr. Smith is not a writer
who has produced a book &#8216;to order;&#8217; he has obviously loved his task. Years of
thought and study, and familiarity with his subject in all its bearings, have enabled
him to tell us everything needful to be known by those who keep the bird&mdash;one
or many; how best to be its friend and its doctor; how to improve without
impairing nature; how, in a word, the extremest amount of enjoyment may be
derived from the cultivation of those delicious little inmates of our homes. The
book is a delightful book; it may give pleasure to those who do not keep the
birds; but to those who do it will be indispensable.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Art Journal.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;A tasteful little book, written evidently by an enthusiast in the study of the
beautiful and innocent creatures whose habits he describes. It is likely to make
the canary a greater favourite than ever.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Morning Star.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;A large amount of pleasure combined with much curious information, may be
easily enjoyed by families or young folks who choose to follow Mr. Smith&#8217;s directions.
The book is written in a pleasing style, and will take its place as a popular
manual and an ornament for the drawing-room table.&#8221;&mdash;<i>The Student.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;The style in which the author details the various incidents connected with his
little pets is so pleasant and so alluring, that really one feels inclined on laying down
the book to rush out forthwith to the nearest dealer, and without delay secure the
necessary material for the formation of an aviary.&#8221;&mdash;<i>City Press.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;This volume contains matter valuable to all who are interested in its subject;
while to those who have never paid attention to the canary the work can hardly fail
to open up a source of attraction. The reverend author is an enthusiastic lover of
the bird, and the result of his experience should find favour with all who share his
enthusiasm.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Glasgow Herald.</i></p></div>

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
